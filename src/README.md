## BTW,

- Entire theory was based on google searches

- Tried to keep the notes short but failed in some areas.

- Navigating through the notes is pretty easy:

  - Sidebar can be toggled with the help of the hamburger menu in the top left
    corner.

  - Use the paint brush button to change the theme.

  - Search button for fast fuzzy search through the entire book.

- To read more information about a topic, look for "More Details" whenever
  necessary. They are a link to the topic's resource.

- You might find dropdowns in some places. They were added for unnecessary
sections but quick reference just in case.

- Improvements are welcome. Email me at: <zim@onionmail.org>
