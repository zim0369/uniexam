## BTW,

- I have tried to keep notes as short as possible

- Navigating through notes is pretty easy:

  - Sidebar can be toggled with the help of the hamburger menu in the top
    left corner.

  - Use the paint brush button to change the theme.

  - Search button for fast fuzzy search through the entire book.

- Entire theory was based on google searches

- If a topic seems like it needed more theory then a link to the resource was
  added. Look for "More Details" whenever necessary.

- Improvements are welcome. Email me at: <zim@onionmail.org>
