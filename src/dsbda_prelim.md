# Questions

**Questions from SKN's recent(May 2022) prelim examinations**

1.  **Define the term big data and explain the characteristics of big data.**

    *   [Refer Intro to Big Data](u3.1.md#introduction-to-big-data)

2.  **Mention any three applications of big data.**

    *   [Refer Applications of Big Data
        section](u3.1.md#applications-of-big-data)

3.  **Draw the data analytics life cycle. Explain in brief the 6 phases of data
    analytics life cycle.**

    *   [Refer to Data Analytic Lifecycle](u3.1.md#data-analytic-lifecycle)

4.  **Give the overview and importance of data analytics life cycle.**

    *   Data Analytics Lifecycle defines the roadmap of how data is generated,
        collected, processed, used, and analyzed to achieve business goals. It
        offers a systematic way to manage data for converting it into
        information that can be used to fulfill organizational and project
        goals. The process provides the direction and methods to extract
        information from the data and proceed in the right direction to
        accomplish business goals.

    *   Data professionals use the lifecycle’s circular form to proceed with
        data analytics in either forward or backward direction. Based on the
        newly received insights, they can decide whether to proceed with their
        existing research or scrap it and redo the complete analysis. The Data
        Analytics lifecycle guides them throughout this process.

5.  **State and explain various sources of big data along with suitable
    examples.**

    *   [Refer to Sources of Big Data](u3.1.md#sources-of-big-data)

6.  **Give the real life example of data analytics life cycle.**

    *   Consider an example of a retail store chain that wants to optimize its
        products’ prices for boosting its revenue. The store chain has thousands
        of products over hundreds of outlets, making it a highly complex
        scenario. Once you identify the store chain’s objective, you find the
        data you need, prepare it, and go through the Data Analytics lifecycle
        process.

    *   You observe different types of customers, such as ordinary customers and
        customers like contractors who buy in bulk. According to you, treating
        various types of customers differently can give you the solution.
        However, you don’t have enough information about it and need to discuss
        this with the client team.

    *   In this case, you need to get the definition, find data, and conduct the
        hypothesis testing to check whether various customer types impact the
        model results and get the right output. Once you are convinced with the
        model results, you can deploy the model, integrate it into the business,
        and you are all set to deploy the prices you think are the most optimal
        across the outlets of the store.

7.  **Differentiate between predictive big data analytics and descriptive big
    data analytics.**

    *   [Refer to Analytics Types](u3.2.md#analytics-types) but ignore
        Diagnostic type(not mentioned in the syllabus)

8.  **Describe the following data preprocessing techniques along with suitable
    example:**
    1.  **Removing Duplicates**
    2.  **Transformation of data using function or mapping**
    3.  **Replacing values**
    4.  **Handling missing data**

9.  **What is classification? Explain the different scenarios where
    classification based algorithms work more suitably.**

    *   [Refer to Classification](u3.2.md#classification)

10. **What is regression? Explain the different scenarios where regression based
    algorithms work more suitably.**

    *   [Refer to Regression](u3.2.md#regression)

    *   Today, regression models have many applications, particularly in financial
        forecasting, trend analysis, marketing, time series prediction and even drug
        response modeling. Some of the popular types of regression algorithms are
        linear regression, regression trees, lasso regression and multivariate
        regression.

11. **What is dataset? How to load the dataset in Scikit-learn. Explain the data
    preprocessing steps in Scikit-learn.**

    *   [Read about
        dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html)

    *   [Loading dataset with
        scikit](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-load-data-in-python-with-scikit-learn/)

    *   The sklearn.preprocessing package provides several common utility
        functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a
        representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.

    *   In general, learning algorithms benefit from standardization of the data
        set. If some outliers are present in the set, robust scalers or
        transformers are more appropriate. The behaviors of the different
        scalers, transformers, and normalizers on a dataset containing marginal
        outliers is highlighted in Compare the effect of different scalers on
        data with outliers.
