# Unit III: Virtualization in Cloud Computing

*   Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using
    resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a
    physical machine's full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many
    users or environments.02

## Adopting Virtualization

*   Some users may confuse virtualization with cloud computing, but they’re not
    entirely the same.

    *   Virtualization is the creation of a virtual resource such as a server,
        desktop, operating system, file, storage space, or network to help
        businesses manage and scale workloads.

    *   Cloud computing is the sharing of resources, software, applications and
        data as a service. Together, the two can be used to provide even greater
        advantages.

*   Data virtualization is viable for small businesses.

*   While virtualization was first embraced by enterprise operations, it soon
    became clear that the same value proposition held substantial benefits for
    Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs). Cyberattacks and natural disasters can
    hit businesses of all sizes. For SMBs, backing up a virtualized
    infrastructure can be a more viable option to backing up hardware servers.

*   Reasons to adopt virtualization:
    1.  Increased agility for the business
    2.  Better resource deployment
    3.  Greater operational efficiency
    4.  Enhanced security
    5.  Higher availability
    6.  Stronger disaster recovery
    7.  Improved quality of service
    8.  Reduced energy consumption
    9.  Preparation for the cloud

## Types of Virtualization

*   The 7 Types of Virtualization
    1.  OS Virtualization—aka Virtual Machines
    2.  Application-Server Virtualization
    3.  Application Virtualization
    4.  Administrative Virtualization
    5.  Network Virtualization
    6.  Hardware Virtualization
    7.  Storage Virtualization

## Virtualization architecture & software

### Virtualization architecture

*   A virtualization architecture is a conceptual model specifying the
    arrangement and interrelationships of the particular components involved in
    delivering a virtual -- rather than physical -- version of something, such
    as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network
    resources.

### Virtualization software

*   Virtualization software, also called hypervisor, allows a single host
    computer to create and run one or more virtual environments.

*   Virtualization software is most often used to emulate a complete computer
    system in order to allow a guest operating system to be run, for example
    allowing Linux to run as a guest on top of a PC that is natively running a
    Microsoft Windows operating system (or the inverse, running Windows as a
    guest on Linux).

*   Uses of virtualization software:
    1.  **Back up**: You can backup your entire operating system or server
        installation as a virtual OS.
    2.  **Run a different OS**: Let's say you want to try out Linux without
        having to install it on a physical hard drive.
    3.  **Run ancient apps**: Say an application you want to run only works on
        win8 and you're using win10 then instead of reinstalling an outdated OS on
        real hardware why not just install windows 8 in a VM.
    4.  **Look at dirty files**: Taking a look at malicious files might put your
        computer and your data at risk so it would be better to check it in a
        sandboxed environment.
    5.  **Using sandboxed browsers**: Hackers have successfully exploited all
        four of most popular browsers — Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
        Safari. Browser plugins can be malicious too. In this case using a sandboxed
        browser like the TOR browser is safer.
    6.  **Try an application**: You just want to check if an application you
        wrote works well on multiple operating systems then using virtual machines
        would be more convenient as compared to installing on real hardware.

## Virtual Clustering

*   Virtual cluster is a many-to-one virtualization technology, which can form a
    routing system from multiple common devices connected through a switching
    network, while performing the same as a single logical router to all
    external appearances.

## Virtual Applications

*   Virtual apps are applications that are optimized to run in a virtual
    environment. Simply put, a virtual app simply runs on a computer without
    being installed on it.

*   Remote apps are a popular virtual app delivery solution wherein the virtual
    applications installed on a server are delivered to users’ devices. These
    applications are not installed on the user’s device; instead, software
    called a client is installed on the device that connects to the server, and
    the application is presented as screenshots sent to the device.

*   ThinApp is an example of an agentless application virtualization solution,
    while Microsoft App-V represents an agent-based virtual app solution.
    Parallels Remote Application Server, Citrix, and VMware are the leading
    providers of application virtualization solutions in the market.

    7.  Time consuming

## Grid, Cloud & Virtualization

### Grid Computing

*   Grid Computing can be defined as a network of computers working together to
    perform a task that would rather be difficult for a single machine. All
    machines on that network work under the same protocol to act as a virtual
    supercomputer.

*   The task that they work on may include analyzing huge datasets or simulating
    situations that require high computing power.

*   Computers on the network contribute resources like processing power and
    storage capacity to the network.

*   Grid computing is also called as "distributed computing." It links multiple
    computing resources (PC's, workstations, servers, and storage elements)
    together and provides a mechanism to access them.

*   The main advantages of grid computing are that it increases user
    productivity by providing transparent access to resources, and work can be
    completed more quickly.

### Virtualization in Cloud

*   Virtualization plays a very important role in the cloud computing
    technology, normally in the cloud computing, users share the data present in
    the clouds like application etc, but actually with the help of
    virtualization users shares the Infrastructure.

*   The main usage of Virtualization Technology is to provide the applications
    with the standard versions to their cloud users, suppose if the next version
    of that application is released, then cloud provider has to provide the
    latest version to their cloud users and practically it is possible because
    it is more expensive.

*   To overcome this problem we use basically virtualization technology, By
    using virtualization, all severs and the software application which are
    required by other cloud providers are maintained by the third party people,
    and the cloud providers has to pay the money on monthly or annual basis.

*   Types of Virtualization in Cloud Computing
    1.  Operating System Virtualization
    2.  Hardware Virtualization
    3.  Server Virtualization
    4.  Storage Virtualization

### Virtualization and Cloud Security.

*   Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, is a collection of
    security measures designed to protect cloud-based infrastructure,
    applications, and data. These measures ensure user and device
    authentication, data and resource access control, and data privacy
    protection. They also support regulatory data compliance. Cloud security is
    employed in cloud environments to protect a company's data from distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, hackers, and unauthorized user
    access or use.

*   Types of clouds
    1.  Public
    2.  Private
    3.  Hybrid

*   Cloud security is critical since most organizations are already using cloud
    computing in one form or another. This high rate of adoption of public cloud
    services is reflected in Gartner’s recent prediction that the worldwide
    market for public cloud services will grow 23.1% in 2021.

*   Virtualized security, or security virtualization, refers to security
    solutions that are software-based and designed to work within a virtualized
    IT environment. This differs from traditional, hardware-based network
    security, which is static and runs on devices such as traditional firewalls,
    routers, and switches.

## Virtualization and Cloud Computing

### Anatomy of Cloud Infrastructure

*   Anatomy of Cloud Computing

    *   **Provisioning and Configuration Module:** It is the lowest level of
        cloud and typically resides on bare hardware (as a firmware) or on the
        top of the hypervisor layer. Its function is to abstract the underlying
        hardware and provide a standard mechanism to spawn instance of virtual
        machine on demand. It also handles the post-configuration of the
        operating systems and applications residing on the VM

    *   **Monitoring and Optimization:** This layer handles the monitoring of
        all services, storage, networking and applications components in cloud.
        Based on the statistics, it could perform routine functions that
        optimize the behavior of the infrastructure components and provide
        relevant data to the cloud administrator to further optimize the
        configuration for maximum utilization and performance,

    *   **Metering and Chargeback:** This layer provides functions to measure
        the usage of resources in cloud. The metering module collects all the
        utilization data per domain per use. This module gives the cloud
        administrator enough data to measure ongoing utilization of resources
        and to create invoices based on the usage on a periodic basis.

    *   **Orchestration:** Orchestration is a central to cloud operations.
        Orchestration converts requests from the service management layer and
        the monitoring, chargeback modules to appropriate action item which are
        then submitted to provisioning and configuration module for final
        closure. Orchestration updates the CMDB in the process.

    *   **Configuration Management Database (CMDB):** It is a central
        configuration repository wherein all the meta data and configuration of
        different modules, resources are kept and updated in the real-time
        basis. The repository can then be accessed using standards protocols
        like SOAP by third-party software and integration components. All
        updates in CMDB happen in real time as requests get processed in cloud.

    *   **Cloud Life cycle Management Layer (CLM):** This layer handles the
        coordination of all other layers in cloud. All requests internal and
        external are addressed to the CLM layer first. CLM may internally route
        requests and actions to other layers for further processing.

    *   **Service Catalog:** It is central to the definition of cloud, SC
        defines what kind of services the cloud is capable of providing and at
        what cost to the end user. SC is the first thing that is drafted before
        a cloud is architecture. The service management layer consults SC before
        it processes any request for a new resource.

### Virtual infrastructures

*   A virtual infrastructure allows you to utilise the IT capabilities of
    physical resources as software that can be used across multiple platforms.
    These resources are shared across multiple virtual machines (VMs) and
    applications for maximum efficiency, creating a virtual infrastructure.

<!-- TODO: Might add some more? -->

### CPU Virtualization

*   CPU Virtualization is a hardware feature found in all current AMD & Intel
    CPUs that allows a single processor to act as if it was multiple individual
    CPUs.This allows an operating system to more effectively & efficiently
    utilize the CPU power in the computer so that it runs faster.

<!-- TODO: need to add some more? -->

### Network and Storage Virtualization.

#### Network Virtualization

Network virtualization is a method of combining the available resources in a
network to consolidate multiple physical networks, divide a network into
segments or create software networks between virtual machines (VMs).

#### Storage Virtualization

Storage virtualization in Cloud Computing is nothing but the sharing of physical
storage into multiple storage devices which further appears to be a single
storage device. It can be also called as a group of an available storage device
which simply manages from a central console.
