# Unit VI: **Planning**

## Automated Planning

*   Automated planning and scheduling, sometimes denoted as simply AI planning, is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles. Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to decision theory.

*   In known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the strategy often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence. These include dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called action languages.

## Classical Planning

*   Classical Planning is the planning where an agent takes advantage of the problem structure to construct complex plans of an action. The agent performs three tasks in classical planning:
    *   Planning: The agent plans after knowing what is the problem.
    *   Acting: It decides what action it has to take.
    *   Learning: The actions taken by the agent make him learn new things.

## Future of AI

*   AI is likely to have a strong impact on certain sectors in particular:

    *   **Medical:** The potential benefits of utilizing AI in the field of
        medicine are already being explored. The medical industry has a robust
        amount of data, which can be utilized to create predictive models related
        to healthcare. Additionally, AI has shown to be more effective than
        physicians in certain diagnostic contexts.

    *   **Automotive:** Weâ€™re already seeing how AI is impacting the world of
        transportation and automobiles with the advent of autonomous vehicles and
        autonomous navigation. AI will also have a major impact on manufacturing,
        including within the automotive sector.

    *   **Cybersecurity:** Cybersecurity is front of mind for many business
        leaders, especially considering the spike in cybersecurity breaches
        throughout 2020. Attacks rose 600% during the pandemic as hackers
        capitalized on people working from home, on less secure technological
        systems and Wi-Fi networks. AI and machine learning will be critical tools
        in identifying and predicting threats in cybersecurity. AI will also be a
        crucial asset for security in the world of finance, given that it can
        process large amounts of data to predict and catch instances of fraud.

    *   **E-Commerce:** AI will play a pivotal role in e-commerce in the future,
        in every sector of the industry from user experience to marketing to
        fulfillment and distribution. We can expect that moving forward, AI will
        continue to drive e-commerce, including through the use of chat-bots,
        shopper personalization, image-based targeting advertising, and warehouse
        and inventory automation.

*   AI can have a big impact on the job search:

    *   If you are moving forward with the hope that a hiring manager may give you
        the benefit of the doubt on a small misstep within the application, you
        might be in for a rude awakening. AI already plays a major role in the
        hiring process, so much so that up to 75% of resumes are rejected by an
        automated applicant tracking system, or ATS, before they even reach a
        human being.

    *   In the past, recruiters have had to devote considerable time to poring
        over resumes to look for relevant candidates. Data from LinkedIn shows
        that recruiters can spend up to 23 hours looking over resumes for one
        successful hire.
