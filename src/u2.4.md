# Unit VI Advanced Techniques in Cloud Computing

## Future Trends in Cloud Computing

1.  **Hybrid/ Multi-Cloud Solutions:** Hybrid cloud computing refers to using a
    combination of the private cloud as well as a third-party public cloud
    service. It is primarily used to allow workloads to move between private and
    public clouds, giving users more flexibility with their computing needs.

2.  **Backup And Disaster Recovery:** Cyber attacks, data outages, and system
    failures are a part and parcel of running a business these days. Most
    businesses have dealt with their servers crashing, leading to loss of
    critical data files. To ensure such issues don’t damage the organization and
    its processes, backup and disaster recovery has become a trending use case
    of the cloud. If Spiceworks reports are to be believed, 15% of the cloud
    budget is allocated to Backup and Disaster Recovery, which is the highest
    budget allocation followed by email hosting and productivity tools.

3.  **Serverless Architecture:** A serverless architecture removes all barriers
    that a standard IT infrastructure would usually bring. Users don’t have to
    purchase or rent the servers that they run their data on. Instead, a
    third-party will handle it all for you, allowing your organization to tackle
    other tasks.

4.  **AI Platform:** As technology advances, one of the most common cloud
    computing trends to look forward to is AI. Tech giants are now looking into
    incorporating AI to process big data to improve their business functioning.

5.  **Cloud Security:** Data theft, leakage, and deletion- security is a big
    challenge even for traditional IT infrastructures. But, with more companies
    moving to cloud platforms, it’s important to ensure that cloud service
    providers can create an airtight security system to guarantee the safety of
    their client’s data.

6.  **IoT Platform:** With a hyper-connected world, one of the most popular
    cloud computing trends is the rise of IoT platforms. A study by Gartner
    suggests the number of connected things in use will be going up to 25
    billion by 2021 from 14.2 billion as of 2019.

7.  **Edge Computing:** It is a method of optimizing cloud computing network
    system by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the
    source of the data. It works real-time on the cloud servers to process less
    time-sensitive data or store data for the long term.

8.  **DevSecOps:** Cloud computing services provide users with a seamless and
    simple experience in managing their data but there are many security risks
    involved.  The security risk of cloud computing includes network
    eavesdropping, illegal invasion, denial of service attacks, side channel
    attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud services.

9.  **Service Mesh:** Since cloud platforms are complex, it is critical to
    ensure that the platform has a fast and safe communication environment. With
    a service mesh, users have a dedicated layer for service-to-service
    communication, making their cloud platform highly dynamic and secure.

10. **Open Source:** This industry is moving towards a path of innovation and
    collaboration. With this shift in how cloud services are managed, many
    organizations are looking at adopting an Open Source cloud computing service
    for their business.

    providers, IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) operators and multimedia
    players. When we consider multimedia players, adopting cloud computing is
    often one of the important priorities in the coming years. Some media
    players, for example, companies like media post-production, already utilize
    these kinds of cloud computing–based service capabilities for managing the
    digital delivery.

*   In the future, multimedia companies will use cloud computing first, who
    started looking to move their storage requirements into cloud computing. The
    cost and the investment return for these kinds of services have accelerated.

### IPTV

*   Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is the delivery of television content
    over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This is in contrast to delivery
    through traditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable television formats.
    Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media
    continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the
    content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as
    streaming media.

*   The increasing complexity of the high performance computing environment has
    provided a range of choices beside traditional supercomputers and clusters.
    Scientists can now use grid and cloud infrastructures, in a variety of
    combinations along with traditional supercomputers - all connected via fast
    networks. And the emergence of many-core technologies such as GPUs, as well
    as supercomputers on chip within these environments has added to the
    complexity. Thus, high-performance computing can now use multiple diverse
    platforms and systems simultaneously, giving rise to the term "computing
    jungle".

## Distributed Cloud Computing Vs Edge Computing

*   A distributed cloud is an architecture where multiple clouds are used to
    meet compliance needs, performance requirements, or support edge computing
    while being centrally managed from the public cloud provider.

*   In essence, a distributed cloud service is a public cloud that runs in
    multiple locations, including:
    *   The public cloud provider’s infrastructure
    *   The public cloud provider’s infrastructure
    *   In another cloud provider’s data center
    *   On third party or colocation center hardware

## Containers

*   Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with
    dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and
    libraries required to run your software services.

*   Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary
    elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the
    operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public
    cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop.

*   Containers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources
    at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in
    which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they
    actually run.

*   Benefits Of Containers:
    *   **Separation of responsibility:** Containerization provides a clear
        separation of responsibility, as developers focus on application logic
        and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and
        management instead of application details such as specific software
        versions and configurations.

    *   **Workload portability:** Containers can run virtually anywhere, greatly
        easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
        systems; on virtual machines or on physical servers; on a developer’s
        machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the public
        cloud.

    *   **Application isolation:** Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage,
        and network resources at the operating system level, providing
        developers with a view of the OS logically isolated from other
        applications.

## Introduction to DevOps

*   DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools
    that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and
    services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace
    than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure
    management processes.

*   A DevOps engineer introduces processes, tools, and methodologies to balance
    needs throughout the software development life cycle, from coding and
    deployment, to maintenance and updates.
