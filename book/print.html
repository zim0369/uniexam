<p>&quot;zero-sum” means that what is good for one player is just as bad for the other:
there is <strong>no “win-win”</strong> outcome. A <strong>utility function</strong> is also called an

<p>Chess is considered a “zero-sum” game,</p>
<p>Game tree is also known as Search tree or space graph</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>Game Theory tries to understand the strategic moves of the players and deicide
the optimal move from the set of all possible moves. To achieve this it makes
use of game tree. A game tree is a recursive search function that examines all
possible moves and their results and then decide the optimal move.</p>
<p>Working:</p>
<p>Start at the current board position,</p>
<p>Check all the possible moves the player can make</p>
<p>From each possible move predict which move the opponent will play</p>
<p>Decide the optimal move based on opponents move and results.</p>
<p>The two players and usually named as MAX and MIN.</p>
<p>MAX moves first, and then the players take turns moving until the game is over</p>
<p>At the end of the game, points are awarded to the winning player and penalties
are given to the loser</p>
<p>A game can be formally defined with the following elements:</p>
<p><strong>Initial state</strong>, which specifies how the game is set up at the start.</p>
<p><strong>TO-MOVE</strong> : The player whose turn it is to move in state</p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS</strong> : The set of legal moves in state</p>
<p><strong>RESULT</strong> : The transition model, which defines the state resulting from taking
action</p>
<p>in state .</p>
<p><strong>TERMINAL</strong> : States where the game has ended are called terminal states.</p>
<p><strong>UTILITY FUNCTION</strong> : A utility function defines the final numeric value to
player when the game ends in terminal state</p>

<h2 id="optimal-decisions-in-games"><a class="header" href="#optimal-decisions-in-games">Optimal Decisions in Games</a></h2>
<p>MIN MAX ALGO</p>
<p>In artificial intelligence, minimax is a<strong>decision-making</strong> strategy under<strong>game
theory,</strong> which is used to minimize the losing chances in a game and to maximize
the winning chances. This strategy is also known as ‘<strong>Minmax,’ ’MM,’ or ‘Saddle
point.’</strong></p>
<p>We can easily understand this strategy via <strong>game tree</strong>- where the <em>nodes
represent the states of the game and edges represent the moves made by the
players in the game</em>. Players will be two namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MIN:</strong> Decrease the chances of <strong>MAX</strong> to win the game.</li>
<li><strong>MAX:</strong> Increases his chances of winning the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>They both play the game alternatively, i.e., turn by turn and following the
above strategy, i.e., if one wins, the other will definitely lose it.</p>
<p>In minimax strategy, the result of the game or the utility value is generated by
a<strong>heuristic function</strong> by propagating from the initial node to the root node.
It follows the<strong>backtracking technique</strong> and backtracks to find the best choice.
MAX will choose that path which will increase its utility value and MIN will
choose the opposite path which could help it to minimize MAX’s utility value.</p>
<p>MINIMAX algorithm is a backtracking algorithm where it backtracks to pick the
best move out of several choices. MINIMAX strategy follows the <strong>DFS (Depth-
first search)</strong> concept. Here, we have two players <strong>MIN and MAX,</strong> and the game
is played alternatively between them, i.e., when <strong>MAX</strong> made a move, then the
next turn is of <strong>MIN.</strong> It means the move made by MAX is fixed and, he cannot
change it. The same concept is followed in DFS strategy, i.e., we follow the
same path and cannot change in the middle. That’s why in MINIMAX algorithm,
instead of BFS, we follow DFS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep on generating the game tree/ search tree till a limit <strong>d.</strong></li>
<li>Compute the move using a heuristic function.</li>
<li>Propagate the values from the leaf node till the current position following
the minimax strategy.</li>
<li>Make the best move from the choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the above figure, the two players <strong>MAX</strong> and <strong>MIN</strong> are</p>
<p>there. <strong>MAX</strong> starts the game by choosing one path and propagating all the
nodes of that path. Now, <strong>MAX</strong> will backtrack to the initial node and choose
the best path where his utility value will be the maximum. After this,</p>
<p>its <strong>MIN</strong> chance. <strong>MIN</strong> will also propagate through a path and again will
backtrack, but <strong>MIN</strong> will choose the path which could minimize <strong>MAX</strong> winning
chances or the utility value.</p>
<p><em><strong>So, if the level is minimizing, the node will accept the minimum value from
the successor nodes. If the level is maximizing, the node will accept the
maximum value from the successor.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The time complexity of MINIMAX algorithm is <strong>O(bd)</strong> where b is the
branching factor and d is the depth of the search tree.</p>

<h2 id="heuristic-alpha-beta-tree-search"><a class="header" href="#heuristic-alpha-beta-tree-search">Heuristic Alpha Beta Tree Search</a></h2>
<p>Alpha-beta pruning is an advance version of MINIMAX algorithm. The drawback of
minimax strategy is that it explores each node in the tree deeply to provide the
best path among all the paths. This increases its time complexity. But as we
know, the performance measure is the first consideration for any optimal
algorithm. Therefore, alpha-beta pruning reduces this drawback of minimax
strategy by less exploring the nodes of the search tree.</p>
<p>The method used in alpha-beta pruning is that it <strong>cutoff the search</strong> by
exploring less number of nodes. It makes the same moves as a minimax algorithm
does, but it prunes the unwanted branches using the pruning technique</p>
<p><strong>Working of Alpha-beta Pruning</strong></p>
<p>Consider the below example of a game tree where <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> are two players.
The game will be played alternatively, i.e., chance by chance. Let, <strong>P</strong> be the
player who will try to win the game by maximizing its winning chances.  <strong>Q</strong> is
the player who will try to minimize **P’**s winning chances. Here, <strong>?</strong>
will represent the maximum value of the nodes, which will be the value for <strong>P</strong>
as well. <strong>?</strong> will represent the minimum value of the nodes, which will be the
value of <strong>Q</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="pics/006.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Any one player will start the game. Following the DFS order, the player will
choose one path and will reach to its depth, i.e., where he will find</li>
</ul>
<p>the <strong>TERMINAL</strong> value.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the game is started by player P, he will choose the maximum value in
order to increase its winning chances with maximum utility value.</li>
<li>If the game is started by player Q, he will choose the minimum value in
order to decrease the winning chances of A with the best possible minimum
utility value.</li>
<li>Both will play the game alternatively.</li>
<li>The game will be started from the last level of the game tree, and the value
will be chosen accordingly.</li>
<li>Like in the below figure, the game is started by player Q. He will pick the
leftmost value of the TERMINAL and fix it for beta (?). Now, the next
TERMINAL value will be compared with the ?-value. If the value will be
smaller than or equal to the ?-value, replace it with the current ?-value
otherwise no need to replace the value.</li>
<li>After completing one part, move the achieved ?-value to its upper node and
fix it for the other threshold value, i.e., ?.</li>
<li>Now, its P turn, he will pick the best maximum value. P will move to explore
the next part only after comparing the values with the current ?-value. If
the value is equal or greater than the current ?-value, then only it will be
replaced otherwise we will prune the values.</li>
<li>The steps will be repeated unless the result is not obtained.</li>
<li>So, number of pruned nodes in the above example are <strong>four</strong> and MAX wins
the</li>
</ul>
<p>game with the maximum <strong>UTILITY</strong> value, i.e.,<strong>3</strong></p>
<p>The rule which will be followed is: <strong>“Explore nodes if necessary otherwise
prune the unnecessary nodes.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is obvious that the result will have the same <strong>UTILITY</strong> value
that we may get from the MINIMAX strategy.</p>
<h2 id="monte-carlo-tree-search"><a class="header" href="#monte-carlo-tree-search">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a></h2>
<p>It is a probabilistic and heuristic driven search algorithm</p>
<p>The basic MCTS strategy does not use a heuristic evaluation function. Instead,
the value of a state is estimated as the average utility over a number of
simulations of complete games starting from the state. A simulation (also called
a playout or rollout) chooses moves first</p>
<p>for one player, than for the other, repeating until a terminal position is
reached. At that point the rules of the game (not fallible heuristics)
determine who has won or lost, and by what score. For games in which the only
outcomes are a win or a loss, “average utility” is the same as “win
percentage.”</p>
<p>pure Monte Carlo search, is to do N simulations starting from the current state
of the game, and track which of the possible moves from the current position has
the highest win percentage.</p>
<p>It balances two factors:</p>
<p>exploration of states that have had few playouts, and exploitation of states
that have done well in past playouts, to get a more accurate estimate of their
value.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo tree search does that by</p>
<p>maintaining a search tree and growing it on each iteration of the following four
steps:</p>
<p>SELECTION: Starting at the root of the search tree, we choose a move (guided by
the selection policy), leading to a successor node, and repeat that process,
moving down the tree to a leaf.</p>
<p>EXPANSION: We grow the search tree by generating a new child of the selected
node; SIMULATION: We perform a playout from the newly generated child node,
choosing moves for both players according to the playout policy. These moves are
not recorded in the search tree.</p>
<p>BACK-PROPAGATION: We now use the result of the simulation to update all the</p>
<p>search tree nodes going up to the root.</p>
<p><img src="pics/007.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Monte Carlo Tree Search:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>MCTS is a simple algorithm to implement.</li>
<li>Monte Carlo Tree Search is a heuristic algorithm. MCTS can operate
effectively without any knowledge in the particular domain, apart from the rules
and end conditions, and can can find its own moves and learn from them by
playing random playouts.</li>
<li>The MCTS can be saved in any intermediate state and that state can be used
in future use cases whenever required.</li>
<li>MCTS supports asymmetric expansion of the search tree based on the
circumstances in which it is operating.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Monte Carlo Tree Search:</strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>As the tree growth becomes rapid after a few iterations, it requires a huge
amount of memory.</li>
<li>There is a bit of a reliability issue with Monte Carlo Tree Search. In
certain scenarios, there might be a single branch or path, that might lead to
loss against the opposition when implemented for those turn-based games. This is
mainly due to the vast amount of combinations and each of the nodes might not be
visited enough number of times to understand its result or outcome in the long
run.</li>
<li>MCTS algorithm needs a huge number of iterations to be able to effectively
decide the most efficient path. So, there is a bit of a speed issue there.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stochastic-games"><a class="header" href="#stochastic-games">Stochastic Games</a></h2>
<p>Stochastic games are simulations of dynamic interactions in which the
environment changes in response to the activities of the participants. &quot;In a
stochastic game, the play progresses by steps from position to position,
according to transition probabilities determined jointly by the two players,&quot;
Shapley writes.</p>
<p>A group of participants participates in a stochastic game. At each stage of the
game, the action takes place in a specific state (or position, in Shapley's
terminology), and each player selects an action from a list of options. The
stage payoff that each player receives is determined by the collection of
actions that the players choose, as well as the current state, as well as a
probability distribution for the subsequent state that the game will visit.</p>
<p>Stochastic games apply von Neumann's model of strategic-form games to dynamic
settings in which the environment varies in response to the players' decisions.
They also use the Markov decision problem model, which was created by numerous
RAND Corporation researchers in 1949–1952, to competitive scenarios with
multiple decision makers.</p>
<p>The complexity of stochastic games arises from the fact that the players'
decisions have two, sometimes opposing, consequences. First, the players'
actions, in combination with the present state, determine the immediate payment
that each player receives. Second, the present state and the players' activities
influence the next state selection, which influences future reward
possibilities. Each player, in particular, must balance these factors when
deciding on his actions, which might be a difficult decision. Although this
dichotomy is also present in one-player sequential decision problems, the
presence of additional players who maximize their own goals adds complexity to
the analysis of the situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Two player Games:</strong> For modelling and analysis of discrete systems
functioning in an uncertain (adversarial) environment, stochastic two-player
games on directed graphs are commonly employed. As vertices, a system's and
its environment's possible configurations are represented, and transitions
correspond to the system's, its environment's, or &quot;nature's&quot; actions. An
infinite path in the graph corresponds to a run of the system. As a result,
a system and its environment can be viewed as two hostile players, with one
player (the system) aiming to maximise the probability of &quot;good&quot; runs and
the other player (the environment) aiming to maximise the chance of &quot;bad&quot;
runs. Although there may be an equilibrium value for this probability in
many circumstances, there may not be optimal solutions for both parties. We
go over some of the fundamental notions and algorithmic concerns that have
been studied in this field, as well as some long-standing outstanding
difficulties. Then we'll go through a few recent findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> Economic theory, evolutionary biology, and computer
networks all use stochastic games. They are generalisations of repeated
games that correspond to the unique case of a single state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Stochastic games are simulations of dynamic interactions
in which the environment changes in response to the activities of the
participants. &quot;In a stochastic game, the play progresses by steps from
position to position, according to transition probabilities determined
jointly by the two players,&quot; Shapley writes.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="partially-observable-games"><a class="header" href="#partially-observable-games">Partially Observable Games</a></h2>
<p>In deterministic partially observable games, uncertainty about the state of the
board arises entirely from lack of access to the choices made by the opponent.</p>
<p>For a partially observable</p>
<p>game, the notion of a strategy is altered; instead of specifying a move to make
for each possible move the opponent might make, we need a move for every
possible percept sequence that might be received.</p>
<p>Card games such as bridge, whist, hearts, and poker feature stochastic partial
observability, where the missing information is generated by the random dealing
of cards.</p>
<p>treat the start of the game as a chance node with every possible deal as an</p>
<p>outcome, and then use the EXPECTIMINIMAX formula to pick the best move.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-in-game-search-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#limitations-in-game-search-algorithm">Limitations in game search algorithm</a></h2>
<p>Alpha–beta search uses the heuristic</p>
<p>evaluation function as an approximation</p>
<p>Monte Carlo search computes an approximate</p>
<p>average over a random selection of playouts.</p>
<p>when the branching factor is high or it is difficult to</p>
<p>define an evaluation function, Monte Carlo search is preferred</p>
<p>One limitation of alpha–beta search is its vulnerability to errors in the
heuristic function.</p>
<p>A second limitation of both alpha–beta and Monte Carlo is that they are designed
to calculate (bounds on) the values of legal moves. But sometimes there is one
move that is obviously best (for example when there is only one legal move), and
in that case, there is no point wasting computation time to figure out the value
of the move</p>
<p>A third limitation is that both alpha-beta and Monte Carlo do all their
reasoning at the level of individual moves.</p>
<h2 id="constraint-satisfaction-problems"><a class="header" href="#constraint-satisfaction-problems">Constraint satisfaction problems</a></h2>
<p>Constraint satisfaction is a technique where a problem is solved when its values
satisfy certain constraints or rules of the problem.</p>
<p>The main idea is to eliminate large portions of the search space all at once by
identifying variable/value combinations that violate the constraints.</p>
<p>A constraint satisfaction problem consists of three components, and : X is a set
of variables, {X1,….Xn}</p>
<p>D is a set of domains, , {D1,.......Dn}, one for each variable.</p>
<p>C is a set of constraints that specify allowable combinations of values.</p>
<p>Where,</p>
<p>X is a set of variables.</p>
<p>D consists of a set of allowable values for each variable</p>
<p>For example, a Boolean variable would have the domain {true, false} .</p>
<p>C is constraint</p>
<p>Each constraint consists of a pair ,<em>(scope, rel)</em> where <em>scope</em> is a tuple of
variables that participate in the constraint and <em>rel</em> is a relation that
defines the values that those variables can take on.</p>
<p>An assignment of values to a variable can be done in three ways:</p>
<p><strong>Consistent or Legal Assignment:</strong></p>
<p>An assignment which does not violate any constraint or rule is called Consistent
or legal assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Assignment:</strong></p>
<p>An assignment where every variable is assigned with a value, and the solution to
the CSP remains consistent. Such assignment is known as Complete assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Partial Assignment:</strong></p>
<p>An assignment which assigns values to some of the variables only. Such type of
assignments are called Partial assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Partial Solution is a partial assignment that is consistent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why formulate a problem as a CSP?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>CSPs yield a natural representation for a wide variety of problems; it is
often easy to formulate a problem as a CSP.</li>
<li>Years of development work have gone into making CSP solvers fast and
efficient.</li>
<li>a CSP solver can quickly prune large swathes of the search space that an
atomic state-space searcher cannot</li>
</ol>
<p>MCQs</p>
<p>MCQs</p>
<p>The 8-queens problem can also be viewed as a finite-domain CSP. Constraint Types
in CSP</p>
<p>Unary Constraint :</p>
<p>restricts the value of a single variable. For example, in the map-coloring
problem it could be the case that South Australians won’t tolerate the color
green; we can express that with the unary Constraint.</p>
<p>Binary Constraint :</p>
<p>A binary constraint relates two variables. For example, is a binary constraint.
A binary CSP is one with only unary and binary constraints; it can be
represented as a constraint graph.</p>
<p>Global Constraints:</p>
<p>It is the constraint type which involves an arbitrary number of variables.</p>
<h2 id="inference-in-csps"><a class="header" href="#inference-in-csps">Inference in CSPs</a></h2>
<p>Inference is nothing but reaching conclusion or achieving result on the basis of
evidence and reasoning.</p>
<p>In local state-spaces, the choice is only one, i.e., to search for a solution.
But in CSP, we have two choices either:</p>
<p>We can search for a solution or</p>
<p>We can perform a special type of inference called constraint propagation.</p>
<p>Constraint propagation is a special type of inference which helps in reducing
the legal number of values for the variables. The idea behind constraint
propagation is local consistency.</p>
<p>If we treat each variable as a node in a graph  and each binary constraint as an
edge, then the process of enforcing local consistency in each part of the graph
causes inconsistent values to be eliminated throughout the graph. There are
different types of local consistency Namely</p>
<p>Node Consistency:</p>
<p>A single variable (corresponding to a node in the CSP graph) is node-consistent
if all the values in the variable’s domain satisfy the variable’s unary
constraints.</p>
<p>It is easy to eliminate all the unary constraints in a CSP by reducing the
domain of variables with unary constraints at the start of the solving process.</p>
<p>Arc Consistency:</p>
<p>A variable in a CSP is arc-consistent if every value in its domain satisfies the
variable’s binary constraints</p>
<p>The most popular algorithm for enforcing arc consistency is called AC-3 (see
Figure 6.3 ). To make every variable arc-consistent, the AC-3 algorithm
maintains a queue of arcs to consider.</p>
<p>Path Consistency:</p>
<p>When the evaluation of a set of two variable with respect to a third variable
can be extended over another variable, satisfying all the binary constraints. It
is similar to arc consistency.</p>
<p>k-consistency:</p>
<p>Stronger forms of propagation can be defined with the notion of -consistency. A
CSP is - consistent if, for any set of variables and for any consistent
assignment to those variables, a consistent value can always be assigned to any
th variable</p>
<h2 id="backtracking-search-for-csps"><a class="header" href="#backtracking-search-for-csps">Backtracking search for CSPs</a></h2>
<p>The minimum-remaining-values and degree heuristics are domain-independent</p>
<p>methods for deciding which variable to choose next in a backtracking search. The
least constraining- value heuristic helps in deciding which value to try first
for a given</p>
<p>variable. Backtracking occurs when no legal assignment can be found for a
variable. Conflict-directed backjumping backtracks directly to the source of the
problem.</p>
<p>Constraint learning records the conflicts as they are encountered during search
in order</p>
<p>to avoid the same conflict later in the search.</p>
<p>The complexity of solving a CSP is strongly related to the structure of its
constraint</p>
<p>graph. Tree-structured problems can be solved in linear time.</p>
<p>Cutset conditioning can reduce a general CSP to a tree-structured one and is
quite efficient (requiring only linear</p>
<p>memory) if a small cutset can be found.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="unit-iv-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#unit-iv-knowledge">Unit IV: <strong>Knowledge</strong></a></h1>
<h2 id="knowledge-based-agents"><a class="header" href="#knowledge-based-agents">Knowledge Based Agents</a></h2>
<p>knowledge-based agents use a process of reasoning over an internal
representation of</p>
<p>knowledge to decide what actions to take. Knowledge-based agent uses some
task-specific knowledge to solve a problem efficiently.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based agents can accept</p>
<p>new tasks in the form of explicitly described goals; they can achieve competence
quickly by</p>
<p>being told or learning new knowledge about the environment; and they can adapt
to</p>
<p>changes in the environment by updating the relevant knowledge.</p>
<p>the representation of knowledge is done via logics.</p>
<p>There are three main components of logic, which are as follows:</p>
<p>Syntax: It is the sequence of a specific language which should be followed in
order to form a sentence. Syntax is the representation of a  language. Every
language has its own syntax.</p>
<p>For example, ax2+bx+c is a well-formed syntax of a quadratic equation.</p>
<p>Semantics: The sentence or the syntax which a logic follows should be
meaningful. Semantics defines the sense of the sentence which relates to the
real world.</p>
<p>For example, Indian people celebrate Diwali every year. This sentence represents
the true fact about the country and its people who are Indians.</p>
<p>Each sentence is expressed in a language called a knowledge representation
language and</p>
<p>represents some assertion about the world.</p>
<p>When the sentence is taken as being given</p>
<p>without being derived from other sentences, we call it an axiom.</p>
<p>A knowledge-based system comprises of two distinguishable features which are:</p>
<p>A Knowledge base</p>
<p>An Inference Engine</p>
<p>Knowledge base: A Knowledge base represents the actual facts which exist in the
real world. It is the central component of a knowledge-based agent. It is a set
of sentences which describes the information related to the world.</p>
<p>Note: Here, a sentence is not an English language sentence, but it is
represented in a language known as Knowledge representation language.</p>
<p>Inference Engine: It is the engine of a knowledge-based system which allows to
infer new knowledge in the system.</p>
<p>There must be a way to add new sentences to the knowledge base and a way to
query what is known. The standard names for these operations are TELL and ASK,
respectively.</p>
<p>When the agent solves a problem, it calls the agent program each time. The agent
program performs three things:</p>
<p>It TELLS the knowledge base what it has perceived from the environment.</p>
<p>It ASKS the knowledge base about the actions it should take?</p>
<p>It TELLS the action which is chosen, and finally, the agent executes that
action.</p>
<p><img src="pics/008.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="pics/009.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>These functions create an interface between the two main components of an
intelligent agent, i.e., sensors and actuators.</p>
<p><img src="pics/010.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The functions are discussed below:</p>
<p>MAKE-PERCEPT-SENTENCE()</p>
<p>This function returns a sentence which tells the perceived information by the
agent at a given time.</p>
<p>MAKE-ACTION-QUERY()</p>
<p>This function returns a sentence which tells what action the agent must take at
the current time.</p>
<p>MAKE-ACTION-SENTENCE()</p>
<p>This function returns a sentence which tells an action is selected as well as
executed.</p>
<h2 id="wumpus-word"><a class="header" href="#wumpus-word">Wumpus Word</a></h2>
<p>The Wumpus world is a game playing which provides an environment to the

<li>It is a 4X4 grid of rooms.</li>
<li>The player always starts in the square labeled [1,1] and facing towards the

<li><strong>Actuators:</strong> The player performs the following actions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The agent can move forward or TurnLeft by 900 and TurnRight by 900.</li>
<li>The player dies if he enters a room having a pit or alive monster. It is

bit of information:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The player will perceive a <em><strong>Stench</strong></em>, if Wumpus is present in the room
which is directly adjacent to the player.</li>
<li>The player will perceive a <em><strong>Breeze</strong></em>, if in the square is directly
adjacent to the pit.</li>
<li>The player will perceive a <em><strong>Glitter</strong></em>, if in the square gold is present.</li>

<p>in each case for which the agent draws a conclusion from the available</p>
<p>information, that conclusion is guaranteed to be correct if the available
information is correct. This is a fundamental property of logical reasoning</p>
<h2 id="logic"><a class="header" href="#logic">Logic</a></h2>
<p>A logic is a formal language that allows sound inference and has well defined
syntax and semantics. There are various logics that allow you to represent
various types of things and allow for more or less efficient inference.
Different varieties of logic exist, such as propositional logic, predicate
logic, temporal logic, and description logic. However, expressing something in
logic may not be natural, and conclusions may be ineffective.</p>

<h2 id="propositional-logic-a-very-simple-logic"><a class="header" href="#propositional-logic-a-very-simple-logic">Propositional Logic: A Very Simple Logic,</a></h2>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> The statements given in a problem are represented via propositional
symbols. Each sentence consists of a single propositional symbol. The
propositional symbol begins with an uppercase letter and may be followed by some
other subscripts or letters. We have two fixed propositional symbols, i.e., True
and False.</p>
<p>Complex sentences are constructed from simpler sentences, using parentheses and</p>
<p>operators called logical connectives. There are five connectives in common use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>not(¬):</strong> It is known as the <strong>negation</strong> of a sentence. A literal can be
a positive literal or a negative literal.</li>
<li><strong>and(^):</strong> When a sentence is having <strong>(^)</strong> as the main connective. It is
known</li>
</ul>
<p>as <strong>Conjunction,</strong> and its parts are known as <strong>Conjuncts</strong>. For example, <strong>(Y1
^ Y2) ? (Y3 ^ Y4) ? …(Yn ^ Ym),</strong> such type of sentences are known as
<strong>Conjunctive sentences</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>or(V):</strong> When a sentence is having <strong>(V)</strong> as the main connective. It is
known as <strong>Disjunction,</strong> and its parts are known as <strong>Disjuncts</strong>. For
example, <strong>(Y1 ? Y2) V (Y3 ? Y4) V …(Yn ? Ym),</strong> such type of sentences are
known as <strong>Disjunctive sentences</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>implies(=&gt;):</strong> When <strong>(Y1 V Y2) =&gt; Y3</strong> is given, it is known as the
<strong>Implication of a sentence</strong>. It is like <strong>if-&gt;then</strong> clause, where if this
implies then it will happen. Implication is sometimes referred to as <strong>Rules
or if-then</strong> statement. It can also be d<strong>eno</strong>ted as (      ) or (       ).</li>
<li><strong>if and only if (<strong>ó</strong>):</strong> It represents implication at both sides where
the expression is <strong>(a1 V a2)</strong>?<strong>a3</strong>,. Such type of connective is called
<strong>biconditional implication</strong>. It returns true if both sides satisfy one
another, else returns false.This can also be denoted as (?).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Precedence Order of the Connectives</strong></p>
<p><img src="pics/012.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>There are following five rules regarding the semantics of the complex
sentences P and Q in a given model m :</strong></p>
<p><strong>¬P:</strong> Its value will be false, iff it is true in the model m.</p>
<p><strong>(P ? Q):</strong> Its value is true, iff both P and Q are true in m.</p>
<p><strong>(P v Q):</strong> Its value is true, iff either P is true, or Q is true in m.</p>
<p><strong>(P=&gt; Q):</strong> Its value is true, iff the value of P is false, and that of Q is
true in m.</p>
<p><strong>(P ? Q):</strong> The value will be true, iff P and Q value is either true or false
in the given <strong>(P ? Q):</strong> The value will be true, iff P and Q value is either
true or false in the given model m.</p>

<h2 id="first-order-logic"><a class="header" href="#first-order-logic">First Order Logic</a></h2>
<p>First-order logic is also called first-order predicate calculus; it may be
abbreviated as FOL or FOPC.</p>
<p>In predicate logic, the input is taken as an entity, and the output it gives is
either true or false.</p>
<p><strong>Elements and their symbols in Predicate Logic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objects:</strong> It refers to an entity that exists in the real world. <strong>For
example,</strong> Ram, John, etc. are referred to as Objects.</li>
<li><strong>Functions:</strong> Any function performed by the object/on the object. <strong>For</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>example,</strong> LeftLeg, writes, eats, etc. are some of the functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relations:</strong> The relation of an object with the other object defines its
relation**. For example,** brother, mother, king, etc. are some types of
relations which exist in the real world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The symbols used to represent these elements. They are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant Symbols:</strong> These symbols are used to represent the objects.</li>
<li><strong>Predicate Symbols:</strong> These symbols are used to represent relations.</li>
<li><strong>Function Symbols:</strong> These symbols are used to represent the functions
performed by the object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples follow:</p>
<p>“One plus two equals three.” Objects: one, two, three, one plus two; Relation:
equals; Function: plus. (“One plus two” is a name for the object that is
obtained by applying the function “plus” to the objects “one” and “two.” “Three”
is another name for this object.) “Squares neighboring the wumpus are smelly.”
Objects: wumpus, squares; Property: smelly; Relation: neighboring.</p>
<p>“Evil King John ruled England in 1200.” Objects: John, England, 1200; Relation:
ruled during; Properties: evil, king.</p>
<p>The primary difference between propositional and first-order logic</p>
<p>Propositional logic assumes</p>
<p>that there are facts that either hold or do not hold in the world. Each fact can
be in one of two states—true or false—and each model assigns true or false to
each proposition symbol. First-order logic assumes more; namely, that the world
consists of</p>
<p>objects with certain relations among them that do or do not hold.</p>
<h2 id="representation-revisited"><a class="header" href="#representation-revisited">Representation Revisited</a></h2>
<p>Programming languages (such as C++, Java, and Lisp) are by far the most widely
used formal languages.</p>
<p>This procedural method contrasts with propositional logic's declarative
character, in which knowledge and inference are separated and inference is
domain- independent.</p>
<p>They lack the expressiveness required to deal with incomplete data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using disjunction and negation, propositional logic has enough expressive
capability to deal with partial knowledge.</li>
<li>Compositionality is a third characteristic of propositional logic that is
useful in representation languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meaning of a sentence in a compositional language is determined by the
meaning of its constituent elements.</p>
<p>For example, ―S1,4 ^ S1,2‖ is related to the meanings of ―S1,4‖ and ―S1,2‖.</p>
<p>Propositional logic lacks the expressive power to succinctly explain a complex
environment with numerous items.</p>
<p>For example, we were compelled to establish a distinct regulation for each
square regarding breezes and pits, such as: <code>B 1,1⇔(P 1,2 or P 2,1)</code></p>
<p>In English, though, it seems simple enough to state unequivocally that squares
near to pits are airy.</p>
<p>Natural languages are also non-compositional, in the sense that the meaning of a
statement like &quot;Then she saw it&quot; might be influenced by the context created by
numerous preceding and following sentences.</p>
<p>Finally, natural languages contain ambiguity, which can make thinking harder.</p>
<p>The following are the most obvious features of natural language syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object-referential nouns and noun phrases ( squares , pits, wumpuses ).</li>
<li>Verbs and verb phrases that allude to object relationships (is breezy, is
adjacent to, shoots).</li>
<li>Some of these relationships are functions, meaning they have only one value
for each input. It's simple to start a list of objects, relations, and
functions:</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects: People, houses, numbers, theories, Ronald McDonald, colors, baseball
games, wars, centuries….</p>
<p>Relation: These can be unary relations or properties like red, round, bogus,
prime, multi-storied............, or more general n-ary relations like brother
of, bigger than, within, part of, has colour, happened after, owns, comes
between, etc.</p>
<p>Functions: father of, closest friend, third inning of, more than, and the start
of.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first-order logic language has a syntax and semantics based on objects
and relations.</li>
<li>First-order logic can also be used to convey facts about some or all of the
universe's items.</li>
<li>This allows generic laws or norms to be represented, such as the sentence
&quot;Squares adjacent to the Wumpus are stinky.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The ontological commitment made by each language—that is, what it assumes about
the nature of reality—is the basic difference between propositional and first-
order logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Propositional logic, for example, assumes that there are facts in the world
that either hold or do not hold. There are two possible states for each
fact: true or untrue.</li>
<li>Temporal logic assumes that facts are true at specific moments and that
those times (which can be points or intervals) are in chronological
sequence. Higher-order logic considers the first-order logic's relations and
functions to be objects in and of themselves. This enables claims to be made
about all object relations. A talent for dealing with logical notation is
required of an AI student.</li>

<h2 id="syntax-and-semantics-of-first-order"><a class="header" href="#syntax-and-semantics-of-first-order">Syntax and Semantics of First Order</a></h2>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> It defines the way of representing the given predicates. As these
predicates are represented via quantifiers, there are different types of
quantifiers used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal Quantifier(For all/every):</strong> When the predicate is indicating
about all/everything, we use <strong>for all</strong> quantifier. It is denoted as <strong>&quot; ?
&quot;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Existential Quantifier(For some):</strong> When the predicate is indicating about
some quantity, we use <strong>for some</strong> quantifier. It is denoted as <strong>“?”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nested Quantifiers:</strong> It is the nesting of the same type of quantifier.
One predicate is nested under the other predicate.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic Sentences:</strong> These sentences are formed via predicate symbols</li>
</ul>
<p>may or may not be followed by a list of terms.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Parents(Ram, Sita) where Ram and Sita are the parents.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Sentences:</strong> These sentences make use of logical connectives to
construct more complex sentences.</li>
<li><strong>Equality:</strong> We use the equality symbol to express that two terms refer to
the same object**. For example,** Eleveenth_President(India)= Dr. APJ
Abdul Kalam. Here, both LHS is equal to RHS. It means that both terms refer
to the same entity/ person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Semantics:</strong> It defines the sense of the given predicate. It allows to make
more logical expression by devising its semantics. Semantics allow us to
understand the sentence meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s understand Predicate logic with the help of below examples: Example 1:</strong>
Lipton is a tea.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, the object is Lipton.</p>
<p>It will be represented as <strong>Tea(Lipton).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this example, there is no requirement of quantifiers because the
quantity is not specified in the given predicate. <strong>Let’s see more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Every man is mortal.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, the quantifier is the universal identifier, and the object
is man. Let x be the man.</p>
<p>Thus, it will be represented as <strong>x: man(x)  ? mortal(x).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> All girls are beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, we are talking about all girls. It means universal
quantifier will be used. The object is girls. Let, y be the girls.</p>
<p>Therefore, it will be represented as <strong>girls(y) ? beautiful(y).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> All that glitters is not gold.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Here, we will represent gold as x.</p>
<p>Therefore, it will be represented as <strong>glitters(x) ? ¬gold(x).</strong></p>

<p>Process of knowledge base construction in called knowledge engineering.</p>
<p>a knowledge engineer investigates a specific domain, learn the important
concepts regarding that domain, and creates the formal representation of the
objects and relations in that domain.</p>
<p>There are 7 steps in knowledge engineering:</p>
<p><img src="pics/016.png" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<li>IDENTIFY THE QUESTIONS</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A knowledge engineer should be able to identify the task by asking a few
questions like:</li>
<li>Do the knowledge base will support?</li>
<li>What kinds of facts will be available for each specific problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>The task will identify the knowledge requirement needed to connect the problem
instance with the answers.</p>
<p>instance with the answers.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>ASSEMBLE THE RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A knowledge engineer should be an expert in the domain. If not, he should
work with the real experts to extract their knowledge. This concept is</li>
</ul>
<p>known as <strong>Knowledge Acquisition</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here, we do not represent the knowledge formally. But to understand
the scope of the knowledge base and also to understand the working of the
domain.</p>
<p>For the wumpus world, which is defined by an artificial set of rules, the
relevant</p>
<p>knowledge is easy to identify.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>DECIDE ON A VOCABULARY OF PREDICATES, FUNCTIONS, AND CONSTANTS.</li>

<li>Translating important domain-level concepts into logical level concepts.
<strong>Here, the knowledge engineer asks questions like:</strong></li>
<li>What are the elements which should be represented as objects?</li>
<li>What functions should be chosen?</li>
</ul>
<p>After satisfying all the choices, the vocabulary is decided.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>ENCODE GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DOMAIN</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In this step, the knowledge engineer pen down the axioms for all the chosen</li>

<p>•</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encode description of the specific problem instance:</strong> We write the simple
atomic sentences for the selected vocabulary terms. We encode the chosen
problem instances.</li>
<li><strong>Raise queries to the inference procedure and get answers:</strong> It is the
testing step. We apply the inference procedure on those axioms and
problem-specific facts which we want to know.</li>
<li><strong>Debug the knowledge base:</strong> It is the last step of the knowledge
engineering process where the knowledge engineer debugs all the errors.</li>

<p>Logic to generate new facts or sentences from current ones. It's crucial to
understand some basic FOL terms before diving into the FOL inference rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Substitution:</strong> Substitution is a fundamental approach for modifying
phrases and formulations. All first-order logic inference systems contain
it. The substitution becomes more difficult when there are quantifiers in
FOL. We refer to the replacement of a constant &quot;a&quot; for the variable &quot;x&quot; when
we write F[a/x].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equality:</strong> Atomic sentences are generated in First-Order Logic not only
through the employment of predicate and words, but also through the
application of equality. We can do this by using equality symbols, which
indicate that the two terms relate to the same thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FOL inference rules for quantifier:</strong> Because inference rules in
first-order logic are comparable to those in propositional logic, below are
some basic inference rules in FOL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Generalization</li>
<li>Universal Instantiation</li>
<li>Existential Instantiation</li>
<li>Existential introduction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Universal Generalization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Universal generalization is a valid inference rule that states that if
premise P(c) is true for any arbitrary element c in the universe of
discourse, we can arrive at the conclusion x P. (x).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be represented as: <em>formula not visible</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we want to prove that every element has a similar property, we can
apply this rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x must not be used as a free variable in this rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's represent, P(c): &quot;A byte contains 8 bits&quot;, so for ∀ x
P(x) &quot;All bytes contain 8 bits.&quot;, it will also be true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Universal Instantiation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Universal instantiation, often known as universal elimination or UI, is
a valid inference rule. It can be used numerous times to add more
sentences.</li>
<li>The new knowledge base is logically equivalent to the previous one.</li>
<li>We can infer any phrase by replacing a ground word for the variable,
according to the UI.</li>
<li>According to the UI rule, any phrase P(c) can be inferred by
substituting a ground term c (a constant inside domain x) for any object
in the universe of discourse in x P(x).</li>
<li>It can be represented as: <em>formula not visible</em></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> IF &quot;Every person like ice-cream&quot;=&gt; ∀x P(x) so we can infer
that &quot;John likes ice-cream&quot; =&gt; P(c)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existential Instantiation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Existential Elimination, also known as Existential Instantiation, is a
valid first- order logic inference rule.</li>
<li>It can only be used once to substitute for the existential sentence.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that the new KB is not conceptually identical to the
previous KB, it will suffice if the old KB was.</li>
<li>This rule states that one can infer P(c) from the formula given in the
form of ∃x P(x) for a new constant symbol c.</li>
<li>The only constraint with this rule is that c must be a new word for
which P(c) is true.</li>
<li>It can be represented as:  <em>formula not visible</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existential introduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An existential generalization, also known as an existential
introduction, is a valid inference rule in first-order logic.</li>
<li>If some element c in the world of discourse has the characteristic P, we
can infer that something else in the universe has the attribute P,
according to this rule.</li>
<li>It can be represented as:  <em>formula not visible</em></li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Let's say that, &quot;Pritisha got good marks in English.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, someone got good marks in English.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Propositional vs. First-Order Inference:</strong> Previously, inference in first
order logic was checked via propositionalization, which is the act of
turning the Knowledge Base included in first order logic into propositional
logic and then utilizing any of the propositional logic inference mechanisms
to check inference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In First-Order Logic, inference is used to derive new facts or sentences
from existing ones.</li>
<li>In First-Order Logic, atomic sentences are formed not only via the use
of predicate and words, but also via the application of equality.</li>
<li>There are some Inference rules that can be applied to sentences with
quantifiers to obtain sentences without quantifiers.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It is the key component of First-order inference algorithms. Unification is
the process used by the lifted inference rules to find substituents that
could give identical but different logical expressions. It means the meaning
of the sentence should not be changed, but it should be expressed in
multiple ways. The <strong>UNIFY</strong> algorithm in unification takes two sentences as
input and</p>
<p>then returns a unifier if one exists:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- CODE -->
<pre><code>UNIFY(p,q)= ? where SUBST( ? , p) = SUBST( ?, ).

<p><strong>Unification Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we have studied <strong>TELL</strong> and <strong>ASK</strong> functions which are used to inform
and interrogate a knowledge base. These are the primitive functions</p>
<p>of <strong>STORE</strong> and <strong>FETCH</strong> functions**. STORE** function is used to store a</p>
<p>sentence <strong>s</strong> into the knowledge base and <strong>FETCH</strong> function is used to return
all the unifiers with some sentences.</p>
<p>A simple scheme called predicate indexing puts all the</p>
<p>facts in one bucket and all the brother facts in another. The buckets can be
stored in a hash table for efficient access.</p>
<p>Predicate indexing is useful when there are many predicate symbols but only a
few clauses for each symbol</p>
<h2 id="forward-chaining"><a class="header" href="#forward-chaining">Forward Chaining</a></h2>
<p>First-order definite clauses are disjunctions of literals of which exactly one
is positive. definite clause is either atomic, or is an implication whose
antecedent is a</p>
<p>conjunction of positive literals and whose consequent is a single positive
literal.</p>
<p>A typical first-order definite</p>
<p>clause looks like this:</p>
<p>King(x) ^ Greedy(x)  =&gt; Evil(x) ,</p>
<p>but the literals king(john) and greedy (john) also count as definite clauses.
First-order literals can include variables, so Greedy(y) is interpreted as
“everyone is greedy” (the universal quantifier is implicit).</p>
<p>In forward chaining, we start with the atomic sentences in the knowledge base
and apply Modus Ponen in forward direction. Also adding new sentences until any
inference is not made.</p>
<p>Starting from the known</p>
<p>facts, it triggers all the rules whose premises are satisfied, adding their
conclusions to the</p>
<p>known facts. The process repeats until the query is answered (assuming that just
one</p>
<p>answer is required) or no new facts are added.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the below axioms:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Gita loves all types of clothes.</li>
<li>Suits are clothes.</li>
<li>Jackets are clothes.</li>
<li>Anything any wear and isn’t bad is clothes.</li>

<h2 id="backward-chaining"><a class="header" href="#backward-chaining">Backward Chaining</a></h2>
<p>These algorithms work backward from the goal, chaining through rules to</p>
<p>find known facts that support the proof. Backward chaining, is clearly a
depth-first search algorithm. is clearly a depth- first search algorithm suffers
from problems with repeated states and incompleteness.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>Consider the below axioms:</strong></p>
<ol>

<p>Gita loves all types of clothes.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2 id="resolution"><a class="header" href="#resolution">Resolution</a></h2>
<p>Resolution works for any knowledge base.</p>
<p>This method is basically used for proving the satisfiability of a sentence. In
resolution method, we use <strong>Proof by Refutation</strong> technique to prove the given
statement.</p>
<p>The key idea for the resolution method is to use the knowledge base and negated
goal to obtain null clause (which indicates contradiction). Resolution method is
also called <strong>Proof by Refutation</strong>. Since the knowledge base itself is
consistent, the contradiction must be introduced by a negated goal. As a result,
we have to conclude that the original goal is true.</p>
<p><strong>In FOPL, the process to apply the resolution method is as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Convert the given axiom into CNF, i.e., a conjunction of clauses. Each
clause should be dis-junction of literals.</li>
<li>Apply negation on the goal given.</li>
<li>Use literals which are required and prove it.</li>
<li>Unlike propositional logic, FOPL literals are complementary if one unifies
with the negation of other literal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Skolemization is the process of removing existential quantifiers by
elimination.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/knowledge_types.png" alt="Knowledge Types" /></p>
<p>Humans are best at understanding, reasoning, and interpreting knowledge. Humans
know things, which is that of the knowledge and as per that of their knowledge
they perform several of the actions in that of the real world. But how machines
do all of these things come under the knowledge representation and the
reasoning. Hence we can describe that of the Knowledge representation as
follows they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge representation and the reasoning (KR, KRR) is the part of
Artificial intelligence which concerned with AI agents thinking and how
thinking contributes to intelligent behaviour of agents.</li>
<li>It is responsible for representing information about the real world so that
a computer can understand and then can utilize that of the knowledge to
solve that of the complex real world problems for instance diagnosis a
medical condition or communicating with humans in natural language.</li>
<li>It is also a way which describes that how we can represent that of the
knowledge in that of the artificial intelligence. Knowledge representation
is not just that of the storing data into some of the database, but it also
enables of an intelligent machine to learn from that of the knowledge and
experiences so that of the it can behave intelligently like that of a human.
What to Represent: Following are the kind of knowledge which needs to be
represented in that of the AI systems:</li>
<li><strong>Object:</strong> All the facts about that of the objects in our world domain.
Example Guitars contains strings, trumpets are brass instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Events:</strong> Events are the actions which occur in our world.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> It describes that of the behaviour which involves the
knowledge about how to do things.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-knowledge:</strong> It is knowledge about what we know.</li>
<li><strong>Facts:</strong> Facts are the truths about the real world and what we represent.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge-Base:</strong> The central component of the knowledge-based agents is
the knowledge base. It is represented as KB. The Knowledgebase is a group of
the Sentences (Here, sentences are used as a technical term and not
identical with the English language). <strong>Knowledge:</strong> Knowledge is the
awareness or familiarity gained by that of the experiences of facts, data,
and situations. Following are the types of knowledge in artificial
intelligence:</li>

<h2 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h2>
<p>The usefulness of situation calculus is limited: it was created to represent a
world in which activities are discrete, instantaneous, and occur one at a time.
Consider filling a bathtub, which is a continual action. Situation calculus can
claim that the tub is empty before the action and filled after the action, but
it can't describe what happens in the middle of the activity. It also can't
depict two simultaneous actions, as cleaning one's teeth while waiting for the
tub to fill. We present an alternative formalism known as event calculus to
address such circumstances, which is based on points of time rather than
situations.</p>
<p>Instances of event categories are used to describe events.4 Shankar's flight

<ul>
<li>E1 ∈ Flyings ∧ Flyer (E1, Shankar ) ∧ Origin(E1, SF) ∧ Destination(E1,DC)</li>

interval i. A (start, finish) pair of times is used to express time intervals.</p>

<h2 id="automated-planning"><a class="header" href="#automated-planning">Automated Planning</a></h2>
<p>The  field  of  Artificial  Intelligence  known  as  Automated  Planning
investigates this discussion process computationally. Its goal is to aid
planning by reasoning on conceptual models, which are abstract and formal
representations of the domain, the effects and combinations of activities, and
the requirements to be met and objectives to be met. The planning domain is the
conceptual model of the domain in which activities are carried out, plans are
combinations of actions, and goals are the needs to be met. Intuitively, a
planning problem entails determining a plan that satisfies the goal in a
specific domain, given a planning domain and a goal. For Automated Planning, we
give a broad formal framework.</p>
<p>Domains, plans, and goals are the three fundamental components of the planning
problem that the framework is built upon.</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong> - We allow for nondeterministic domains, which are domains in which
actions may have varied effects and it is impossible to predict which of the
various possible outcomes will actually occur at the time of planning. We also
take partial observability into account.</p>
<p><strong>Plans</strong> -  We  define  plans  in  which  the  action  to  be  performed  in  a
particular state may be influenced by information about prior execution phases.
There are plans that rely on a finite number of execution steps (finite- memory
plans) and plans that do not rely on prior execution steps (non- memory plans)
(memory-less plans). Plan executions, in general, result in  trees  (called
execution  trees)  whose nodes  correspond  to  domain states.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong> - Goals are defined as sets of acceptable trees that correspond to
intended planning domain evolutions. They can be used to represent traditional
reachability goals, which are requirements expressed on the leaves of execution
trees that specify the end states to be achieved once a plan is performed.</p>
<p>Deterministic  domains,  plans  that  are sequences of actions, and reachability
goals can all be used to mimic traditional planning.</p>
<p>Nondeterministic domains do, in fact, model uncertainty in action effects,
whereas partial observability does so for observations.</p>

<h2 id="classical-planning"><a class="header" href="#classical-planning">Classical Planning</a></h2>
<p>Classical planning is the process of constructing complicated plans of action
using the issue structure as a guide.</p>
<p>Invariants  are  used  in  optimum  planning  (graph  theory,  complexity
theory).</p>
<p>Domain-specific  solvers  are  integrated  to  improve  the  efficiency  of
classical planning on certain domains (puzzles, logistics, video games). Machine
learning  approaches  are  being  used  in  the  planning  and extraction of
structural data (machine learning, deep learning, neural networks).</p>
<p>Optimize your strategy.</p>
<p>In traditional planning, the agent performs three tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>planning: After determining the problem, the agent makes a plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acting: It chooses the course of action to adopt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning: The agent's actions cause him to learn new things.</p>
<p><img src="sam/040.png" alt="" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PDDL  (Planning  Domain Definition  Language)  is  a language  that  is  used to
represent  all  actions  in  a single action schema.</p>
<p>The four basic things required in  a  search  problem  are described by PDLL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial state - Each state is represented  as  the  union  of the  ground
and  functionless atoms in its initial state.</li>
<li>Action - It is defined by a series of action schemas that define the
ACTION() and RESULT() functions implicitly.</li>
<li>Result - The collection of activities taken by the agent yielded this
result.</li>
<li>Goal  -  The  goal  is  the  same  as  a  precondition,  which  is  a
literal conjunction (whose value is either positive or negative).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various examples which will make PDLL understandable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air cargo transport</li>
<li>The spare tire problem</li>
<li>The blocks world and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Classical Planning</strong> Classical planning has the following
benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It  has  enabled  the  development  of  precise  domain-independent
heuristics.</li>
<li>The systems are simple to use and operate efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complexity of the classical planning</strong></p>
<p>There are two decision difficulties that arise in traditional planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlanSAT: is a query that asks if any plan exists that solves a planning
difficulty.</li>
<li>Bounded PlanSAT: It's a question that asks if there's a solution with a
length of k or less.</li>

<p>Now we'll take a look at planning algorithms. We saw how the description of a
planning problem defines a search problem: we can search through the space of
states,  looking for  a  goal, starting from  the initial state. One of the
wonderful features of the declarative representation of action schemas is that
we can search for the initial state backwards from the objective.</p>
<p><strong>Forward (progression) state-space search</strong></p>
<p>Now that we've seen how a planning problem maps to a search problem, we may
utilize any of the heuristic search algorithms or a local search algorithm to
solve planning problems (provided we keep track of the actions used to reach the
goal). Forward state-space search was thought to be too inefficient to be
feasible from the beginning of planning research (about 1961) until roughly
1998. It's not difficult to think of reasons for this.</p>
<p>Second, state spaces in planning issues are frequently huge. Consider a cargo
scenario with ten airports, each having five planes and 20 items of goods. The
objective is to transport all of the cargo from airport A to airport B. The
problem has a straightforward solution: load the cargo into one of the planes at
A, fly the plane to B, and discharge the cargo.</p>
<p><img src="sam/041.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The objective is to transport all of the cargo from airport A to airport B. The
problem has a straightforward solution: load the cargo into one of the planes at
A, fly the plane  to  B,  and  discharge  the  cargo.  The  average  branching
factor  is  high, therefore finding the answer can be difficult: each of the 50
planes can travel to 9 different airports, and each of the 200 packages can be
unloaded (if loaded) or loaded into any plane at its airport (if it is
unloaded). So there are a minimum of 450 activities (when all the packages are
at airports with no planes) and a maximum of 10,450 actions in any situation
(when all packages and planes are at the same airport).</p>
<p>Let's say there are roughly 2000 potential actions per state on average,
therefore the search graph has about 200041 nodes up to the depth of the obvious
solution.</p>
<p><strong>Backward (regression) relevant-states search</strong></p>
<p>In regression search, we begin at the goal and work backwards until we identify
a set of steps that leads to the original state. Because we only evaluate
activities that are related to the objective, it's termed relevant-states search
(or current state). At each phase, just like in belief-state search, there are a
number of relevant states to consider, not just one.</p>
<p>We begin with the goal, which is a set of literals that describes a set of
states—for example, the goal PoorFamous describes states in which Poor is false,
Famous is true, and any other fluent can have any value. There are 2n ground
states (each fluent might be true or false) but 3n descriptions of sets of
target states in a domain with n ground fluents (each fluent can be positive,
negative, or not mentioned).</p>
<h2 id="heuristics-for-planning"><a class="header" href="#heuristics-for-planning">Heuristics for Planning</a></h2>
<p>Without a good heuristic function, neither forward nor backward search is
efficient. Remember that a heuristic function h(s) measures the distance between
a state s and the goal, and that we may utilize A search to identify optimal
solutions if we can  construct  an  admissible  heuristic  for  this
distance—one  that  does  not overestimate. By establishing a relaxed issue that
is easier to solve, an admissible heuristic can be generated. The heuristic for
the original problem is then the exact cost of a solution to this easier
problem.</p>
<p>Consider a search issue as a network with nodes representing states and edges
representing operations. The goal is to find a path from the original state to
the desired state. We may make this problem easier in two ways: by adding more
edges to the graph, making it stricter to identify a path, or by grouping
several nodes together, generating an abstraction of the state space with fewer
states, making it easier to search.</p>
<p>First,  we'll  look  at  heuristics  for  adding  edges  to  the  graph.  The
disregard preconditions  heuristic,  for  example,  removes  all  preconditions
from  actions. Every  action  becomes  relevant  in  every  stage,  and  any
single  goal  can  be accomplished in a single step (assuming an applicable
action exists—if not, the problem is impossible to solve). This almost indicates
that the number of steps required to solve the relaxed problem is equal to the
number of unmet goals— almost, but not quite, because some acts may accomplish
several goals and others may negate the results of others. Consider and ignore
is a good way to get an accurate heuristic for many problems.</p>
<p>First, we loosen up the actions by removing all preconditions and consequences
that aren't literals in the goal. Then we count the least number of activities
required to achieve the goal when the impacts of those actions are added
together. This is a case of the set-cover problem in action. One small annoyance
is that the set-cover problem is NP-hard. Thankfully, a basic greedy algorithm
will always provide a set covering that is within a factor of log n of the true
lowest covering, where n is the number  of  literals  in  the  target.
Unfortunately,  the  greedy  algorithm  loses  its admissibility guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong></p>
<p>Without a good heuristic function, neither forward nor backward search is
efficient. Remember that a heuristic function h(s) measures the distance between
a state s and the goal, and that we may utilize A search to identify optimal
solutions if we can  construct  an  admissible  heuristic  for  this
distance—one  that  does  not overestimate.</p>
<h2 id="hierarchical-planning"><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-planning">Hierarchical Planning</a></h2>
<p>When planning, it's common to have hierarchical information on the actions, or a
description of how complex actions are broken down. For instance, a complicated
activity such as &quot;serving coffee&quot; can be broken down into two complex actions:
&quot;making coffee&quot; and &quot;bringing coffee.&quot; As a result, there exist planners, such
as ABSTRIPS, that take as input the hierarchical description of the activities
in addition to the description of the actions. For example, one can start
planning at a general level  and  then  drill  down  into  the  details  if
necessary  (as  does  ABSTRIPS  for example). A hierarchical task network is
then used to express the goal (HTN).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hierarchical planning, often known as HTN planning, is a planning system
based on the Hierarchical Task Network (HTN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It combines Partial Order Planning and HTN Planning concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTN planning is frequently organized around a single &quot;top-level&quot; action
termed Act, with the purpose of finding an Act execution that meets the
goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first plan is considered as a high-level statement of what needs to be
done in HTN planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decomposition actions are used to refine this strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each action decomposition breaks down a higher-level activity into a jumble
of lower-level actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This deconstruction continues until the plan is reduced to its most basic
actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider  a  hierarchical  travel  plan  from  a  specific  source  to  a
specific destination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="sam/042.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Assume we're traveling from source &quot;Mumbai&quot; to destination &quot;Goa&quot; in the
above hierarchical planner diagram.</li>
<li>Then you can decide how you want to travel: by plane, bus, or car. Assume
you decide to travel by &quot;Bus.&quot;</li>
<li>The &quot;Take-Bus&quot; strategy can then be broken down into a series of tasks, such
as going  to  Mumbai  –  Bus  stop,  purchasing  a  bus  ticket,  boarding
the  bus,  and departing for Goa.</li>
<li>The four acts in the previous point can now be split down into their
component parts. Take, for example, &quot;By-Ticket for Bus.&quot;</li>
<li>It may be broken down into three steps: go to the bus stop counter, request
a ticket, and pay for the ticket.</li>
<li>As a result, each of these actions can be further deconstructed until we
reach the level of actions that can be performed without thought in order to
generate the needed motor control sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Hierarchical Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main advantage of a hierarchical structure is that it reduces the plan
at each level  of  the  hierarchy  to  a  small  number  of  activities  at
the  next  lower  level, lowering the computing cost of determining the best
method to organise those activities for the current challenge.</li>
<li>Many real-world applications demand very big plans, which HTN algorithms may
generate.</li>
<li>In the event that something goes wrong, the hierarchical structure makes it
simple to rectify the problem.</li>
<li>Hierarchical  planning  is  far  more  efficient  than  single-level
planning  for complex issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of Hierarchical Planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Deterministic environment is required by many HTN planners.</li>
<li>Many HTN planners are unable to deal with unpredictable results of actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong></p>
<p>When planning, it's common to have hierarchical information on the actions, or a
description of how complex actions are broken down.</p>

<p>Resources</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong></p>
<p>We allow for nondeterministic domains, which are domains in which actions may
have varied effects and it is impossible to predict which of the various
possible outcomes  will  actually  occur  at  the  time  of  planning.  We  also
take  partial observability into account. It represents the reality that the
state of the domain cannot always be observed completely, and so cannot be
determined uniquely in some instances. The special circumstances of full
observability, where the state may be totally observed and hence uniquely
determined, and null observability, where no observation is ever feasible at run
time, are both included in a model with partial observability.</p>
<p><strong>Time, Schedule and Resources</strong></p>
<p>The standard planning representation can communicate about what to do and in
what order, but it can't talk about how to execute it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporal ordering constraint</strong> - When an activity should occur (before
and/or after  a  particular  time  and/or  specific  action(s)),  there  are
temporal  ordering constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Resource constraints</strong> - outlines the resources required to carry out a
task.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Representing Temporal Constraints, Resource Constraints, and the Available
Resources</strong></p>
<p>Each action is represented by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A period of time</li>
<li>A collection of temporal ordering constraints (actions that must be
performed before this action may be carried out)</li>
<li>A set of limits on resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Each resource is represented by 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resource's kind (e.g. Bolts, wrenches, or pilots).</li>
<li>The quantity of that resource at the start.</li>
<li>Whether or not that resource:</li>
<li>Consumable - e.g. The bolts are no longer available for use</li>
<li>Reusable - e.g. a pilot is occupied during a flight but is available again
when the flight is over</li>
<li>Sharable</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions have the ability to generate resources.</p>
<p>A  solution  must  meet  all  of  the  activities'  and  resources'  temporal
ordering constraints.</p>
<p>Example of a Scheduling Issue (Assembly of 2 Cars).</p>
<p>The problem of assembling two cars consists of the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources: There are four different sorts of resources, with a certain
number of each type available at the start: <img src="sam/043.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>
<!-- TABLE -->
<table><thead><tr><th>Resource type</th><th>Number available</th><th>Consumable or reusable</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Engine hoist</td><td>1</td><td>Reusable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wheel station</td><td>1</td><td>Reusable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lug nuts</td><td>500</td><td>Consumable</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inspector</td><td>2</td><td>Reusable</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li>Ordering &amp; resource constraints: 2 jobs, each of form [AddEngine, AddWheels, Inspect] and their individual action durations and its resource constraints <img src="sam/045.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>
<table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Duration units</th><th>Resources constraints</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>AddEngine1</td><td>30</td><td>1 engine hoist</td></tr>
<tr><td>AddEngine2</td><td>60</td><td>1 engine hoist</td></tr>
<tr><td>AddWheels1</td><td>30</td><td>1 wheel station and 40 lug nuts</td></tr>
<tr><td>AddWheels2</td><td>15</td><td>1 wheel station and 40 lug nuts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inspect1</td><td>10</td><td>1 inspector</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inspect2</td><td>10</td><td>1 inspector</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong></p>
<p>We allow for nondeterministic domains, which are domains in which actions may
have varied effects and it is impossible to predict which of the various
possible outcomes  will  actually  occur  at  the  time  of  planning.  We  also
take  partial observability into account.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-planning-approaches"><a class="header" href="#analysis-of-planning-approaches">Analysis of Planning Approaches</a></h2>
<p>Planning brings together the two key AI disciplines we've discussed so far:
search and logic. A planner can be thought of as either a programme that looks
for a solution or one that (constructively) argues that one exists. The
cross-fertilization of ideas from the two fields has resulted in performance
gains of several orders of magnitude over the last decade, as well as a rise
in the usage of planners in industrial applications. Regrettably, we do not
yet have a firm grasp of which strategies  are  most  effective  in particular
situations.  It's  possible  that  new procedures will arise that will
supplant old ones.</p>
<p>For a more complex example, it was determined that the propositions involved in
commanding NASA's Deep Space One spacecraft are serializable for the Remote
Agent  planner  that  commanded  NASA's  Deep  Space  One  spacecraft.  This  is
perhaps unsurprising, given that engineers construct spaceships to be as simple
to manage as possible (subject to other constraints). The Remote Agent planner
was able to eliminate the majority of the search by taking use of the serialized
ordering of goals. This meant it could control the spacecraft in real time,
which had previously been thought impossible.</p>
<p>GRAPHPLAN, SATPLAN, and FF are examples of planners who have advanced the
science of planning by improving the performance of planning systems, explaining
the  representational  and  combinatorial  challenges  involved,  and developing
useful heuristics. However, it is unclear how far these procedures can be
scaled. Further progress on larger issues is likely to require some type of
synthesis of first- order and hierarchical representations with the efficient
techniques already in use, rather than relying solely on factored and
propositional representations.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong></p>

<h2 id="limits-of-ai"><a class="header" href="#limits-of-ai">Limits of AI</a></h2>
<p>The  availability  of  data  is  one  of  the  most  significant  obstacles  to
AI implementation. Data is frequently fragmented, inconsistent, and of low
quality, posing hurdles for firms attempting to leverage AI at scale. To avoid
this, you should have a defined approach for obtaining the data that your AI
will require from the start.</p>
<p>Another major impediment to AI adoption is a skills scarcity and a lack of
technical professionals.</p>
<p>Another important factor to consider when purchasing AI technology is the price.</p>
<p>Cost and maintenance - Purchase costs can be high, and there may be a need for
ongoing maintenance and repair, as with any new technology.</p>
<p>Lack of creativity - A good marketing effort requires a high level of
creativity. Machines just do not possess the ability to think creatively.
Humans, unlike robots, have the ability to think and feel, which influences
their decision-making when it comes to creativity.</p>
<p>Other AI limitations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation  times,  which  can  vary  based  on  what  you're  trying to
accomplish.</li>
<li>Integration issues and a lack of knowledge about cutting-edge technology.</li>
<li>Interoperability with various systems and platforms, as well as usability.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ethics-of-ai"><a class="header" href="#ethics-of-ai">Ethics of AI</a></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence ethics, often known as AI ethics, is a set of beliefs,
ideas, and methodologies that use commonly accepted criteria of right and wrong
to govern moral behavior in the development and deployment of AI systems.</p>
<p>In recent years, the ethics of AI and robotics have gotten a lot of press
attention, which helps support related research but also risks  undermining it:
the press frequently talks as if the issues under discussion are just
predictions of what future technology will bring, and as if we already know what
would be most ethical and how to get there.</p>
<p>Some  technologies,  such  as  nuclear  power,  automobiles,  and  plastics,
have sparked ethical and political debate as well as considerable regulatory
initiatives to  limit  their  trajectory,  usually  after  some  damage  has
been  done.  New technologies,  in  addition  to  &quot;ethical  issues,&quot;  challenge
present  norms  and conceptual frameworks, which is of particular interest to
philosophy.</p>
<p>A variety of ethical challenges have arisen as a result of AI's rapid growth.
These are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The potential for employment loss as a result of automation technologies</li>
<li>Employees must be redeployed or retrained in order to keep their positions.</li>
<li>Machine-created wealth should be distributed fairly.</li>
<li>The impact of human-machine interaction on human attention and behaviour</li>
<li>The necessity to address algorithmic bias in data resulting from human bias</li>
<li>The safety of AI systems that have the capacity to cause harm (e.g.
Autonomous weapons).</li>
<li>Because smart machines are considered to learn and develop independently,
there is a need to guard against unforeseen outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-of-ai"><a class="header" href="#future-of-ai">Future of AI</a></h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a breakthrough discipline of computer science
that is poised to become a key component of several future technologies such as
big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In the coming years, it
will continue to be a technical trailblazer. AI has gone from science fiction to
reality in a few of years. Machines that assist people with intelligence can be
found in the real world as well as in science fiction films. We now live in a
world of Artificial Intelligence, which was only a story a few years ago.</p>
<p>Because  AI  is  such  a  revolutionary  technology,  there  are  numerous
questions concerning its  future and impact on humans. It's risky, but it's also
a fantastic opportunity. Artificial intelligence will be used to improve both
defensive and offensive  cyber  operations.  In  addition,  new cyber-attack
methods  will  be developed to exploit AI technology's specific vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Future impact of AI in different sectors</strong> <img src="sam/046.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> In  the  healthcare  industry,  AI  will  be  critical  in
promptly  and effectively diagnosing ailments. With the help of AI, new drug
discovery will be speedier and more cost-effective. It will also improve patient
engagement in their care by making appointment booking and bill payment easier
and with fewer errors. Apart from these helpful applications, one of AI's
greatest challenges in healthcare is ensuring its acceptance in daily clinical
operations.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber security:</strong> Without a question, ensuring data security is a top
responsibility for every company. The following are some predictions about how
cyber security will alter as a result of AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security incidents will be tracked using AI techniques.</li>
<li>NLP is used to identify the source of cyber-attacks.</li>
<li>RPA bots are used to automate rule-based operations and procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transportation:</strong> In the transportation industry, a fully autonomous vehicle
has not yet been produced, but researchers are working on it.</p>
<p><strong>E-commerce:</strong> In the near future, Artificial Intelligence will play a critical
role in the e-commerce industry. In the  future,  we  can  expect  e-commerce to
include  automated warehouse  and inventory management, shopper personalisation,
and the employment of chatbots.</p>
<p><strong>Employment:</strong> In the job market, AI is already being employed with stringent
regulations and algorithms that automatically reject an employee's résumé if it
does not meet the company's requirements.</p>
<p>Apart from the aforementioned industries, AI has a bright future in
manufacturing, finance and banking, entertainment, and other fields.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a breakthrough discipline of computer science
that is poised to become a key component of several future technologies such as
big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In the coming years, it
will continue to be a technical trailblazer.</p>
<h2 id="ai-components"><a class="header" href="#ai-components">AI Components</a></h2>
<p>Learning, thinking, problem solving, perception, and language use are all
aspects of intelligence.</p>
<p><img src="sam/047.jpeg" alt="" /><strong>Learning</strong></p>
<p>Computer programmes, like humans, learn in a variety of ways. When it comes to
AI, this platform's learning is divided into a variety of categories. Learning
for AI comprises the trial-and-error approach, which is one of the most
important aspects of AI. The solution continues to solve problems until it
obtains the desired results. As a consequence, the programme keeps track of
all the movements that resulted in positive outcomes and stores them in its
database for use the next time the computer is presented with the same
problem.</p>
<p>Individual  things,  such  as  multiple  solutions  to  problems,  vocabulary,
foreign languages, and so on, are memorized as part of AI's learning component,
often known as rote learning. The generalization method is then used to put this
learning process into practice.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Reasoning  is  one  of  the  most  important  components  of  artificial
intelligence because of its ability to differentiate. To reason is to allow the
platform to make inferences  that  are  appropriate  for  the  situation  at
hand.</p>
<p><strong>Problem-solving</strong></p>
<p>Problem  solving,  especially  in  artificial  intelligence,  can  be  defined
as  a methodical search through a set of options in order to arrive at a
predetermined goal or solution. There are two types of problem-solving methods:
special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose approach is designed
specifically for a problem  and  typically  takes  advantage  of  extremely
specific  aspects  of  the scenario in which the problem exists. A
general-purpose method, on the other hand, can be used to solve a wide range of
issues.</p>
<p><strong>Perception</strong></p>
<p>The fact that an object can seem differently depending on the angle from which
it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene,  and how
much  the  object  contrasts  with  the surrounding  field,  makes analysis more
difficult.</p>
<p>Artificial perception has progressed to the point that optical sensors can
identify humans, autonomous vehicles can drive at highway speeds, and robots can
roam through buildings collecting empty drink cans.</p>
<p><strong>Language - understanding</strong></p>
<p>Language can be defined as a collection of diverse system indications that use
convention to justify their means.</p>
<p>Similarly, AI is designed in such a way that it can grasp English, the most
widely spoken human language. In this way, the platform  enables  computers  to
quickly  comprehend  the  many computer programmes that are run on them.</p>
<p>A language is a set of signs with predetermined meaning. Language does not have
to be limited to the spoken word in this sense. For example, traffic signs form
a mini language, with &quot;danger ahead&quot; being a matter of convention in some
nations.</p>
<p><strong>Key takeaway</strong></p>
<p>Learning, thinking, problem solving, perception, and language use are all
aspects of intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="ai-architectures"><a class="header" href="#ai-architectures">AI Architectures</a></h2>
<p>Today's  architecture  is  a  multi-skilled  profession  that  draws  on  a
variety  of disciplines, including structural and environmental engineering, as
well as social and  material  sciences.  We  have  a  long  history  of
studying,  adapting,  and leveraging  available  technology  to  broaden  and
strengthen  our  design capabilities at Foster + Partners. The Applied Research
and Development (ARD) team is at the forefront of this, having recently
investigated the possibilities of employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the
creative process.</p>
<p>Many systems  and processes  must be perfected in order  to  accurately mimic
human intelligence; one example is the AI subset known as machine learning,
which  is  defined  as  &quot;the  study  of  computer  algorithms  that  allow
computer programmes to automatically improve through experience&quot; by computer
scientist Tom Mitchell.</p>
<p>Machine learning has the ability to analyze our designs more rapidly and at a
lower cost  in  the  context  of  architecture  and  design.  The  ARD  team has
been experimenting with two methods for incorporating it into the design
process, as well as some potentially innovative applications.</p>
<p>Many  architectural  projects  today  are  of  immense  scale  and  complexity,
characterized by a diverse array of overlapping talent and technologies. Machine
learning may be able to assist us in this diverse subject by allowing us to
solve problems and find patterns that were previously dependant on complex
analytical simulations  and  programmes.  Due  to  the  time  and  effort
required, design optimization based on their findings has been almost difficult,
weakening the value of these tools.</p>

<li>
<p>A virtualization architecture is a conceptual model specifying the
arrangement and interrelationships of the particular components involved in
delivering a virtual -- rather than physical -- version of something, such
as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network
resources.</p>

Details</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtualization-software"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-software">Virtualization software</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization software, also called hypervisor, allows a single host
computer to create and run one or more virtual environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization software is most often used to emulate a complete computer
system in order to allow a guest operating system to be run, for example
allowing Linux to run as a guest on top of a PC that is natively running a
Microsoft Windows operating system (or the inverse, running Windows as a
guest on Linux).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses of virtualization software:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Back up</strong>: You can backup your entire operating system or server
installation as a virtual OS.</li>
<li><strong>Run a different OS</strong>: Let's say you want to try out Linux without
having to install it on a physical hard drive.</li>
<li><strong>Run ancient apps</strong>: Say an application you want to run only works on
win8 and you're using win10 then instead of reinstalling an outdated OS on
real hardware why not just install windows 8 in a VM.</li>
<li><strong>Look at dirty files</strong>: Taking a look at malicious files might put your
computer and your data at risk so it would be better to check it in a
sandboxed environment.</li>
<li><strong>Using sandboxed browsers</strong>: Hackers have successfully exploited all
four of most popular browsers — Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
Safari. Browser plugins can be malicious too. In this case using a sandboxed
browser like the TOR browser is safer.</li>
<li><strong>Try an application</strong>: You just want to check if an application you
wrote works well on multiple operating systems then using virtual machines
would be more convenient as compared to installing on real hardware.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="virtual-clustering"><a class="header" href="#virtual-clustering">Virtual Clustering</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtual clusters are built with VMs installed at distributed servers from one or more physical clus-ters. The VMs in a virtual cluster are interconnected logically by a virtual network across several physical networks. Figure 3.18 illustrates the concepts of virtual clusters and physical clusters. Each virtual cluster is formed with physical machines or a VM hosted by multiple physical clusters. The virtual cluster boundaries are shown as distinct boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisioning of VMs to a virtual cluster is done dynamically to have the following interest-ing properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The virtual cluster nodes can be either physical or virtual machines. Multiple VMs running with different OSes can be deployed on the same physical node.</li>
<li>A VM runs with a guest OS, which is often different from the host OS, that manages the resources in the physical machine, where the VM is implemented.</li>
<li>The purpose of using VMs is to consolidate multiple functionalities on the same server. This will greatly enhance server utilization and application flexibility.</li>

<h2 id="virtual-applications"><a class="header" href="#virtual-applications">Virtual Applications</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtual apps are applications that are optimized to run in a virtual
environment. Simply put, a virtual app simply runs on a computer without
being installed on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote apps are a popular virtual app delivery solution wherein the virtual
applications installed on a server are delivered to users’ devices. These
applications are not installed on the user’s device; instead, software
called a client is installed on the device that connects to the server, and
the application is presented as screenshots sent to the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ThinApp is an example of an agentless application virtualization solution,
while Microsoft App-V represents an agent-based virtual app solution.
Parallels Remote Application Server, Citrix, and VMware are the leading
providers of application virtualization solutions in the market.</p>

<h3 id="grid-computing"><a class="header" href="#grid-computing">Grid Computing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grid Computing can be defined as a network of computers working together to
perform a task that would rather be difficult for a single machine. All
machines on that network work under the same protocol to act as a virtual
supercomputer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task that they work on may include analyzing huge datasets or simulating
situations that require high computing power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computers on the network contribute resources like processing power and
storage capacity to the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grid computing is also called as &quot;distributed computing.&quot; It links multiple
computing resources (PC's, workstations, servers, and storage elements)
together and provides a mechanism to access them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main advantages of grid computing are that it increases user
productivity by providing transparent access to resources, and work can be
completed more quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloud"><a class="header" href="#cloud">Cloud</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The cloud&quot; refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the
software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located
in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and
companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software
applications on their own machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from
almost any device, because the computing and storage takes place on servers
in a data center, instead of locally on the user device. This is why a user
can log in to their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone
breaks and still find their old account in place, with all their photos,
videos, and conversation history. It works the same way with cloud email
providers like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, and with cloud storage
providers like Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtualization"><a class="header" href="#virtualization">Virtualization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization in cloud computing is defined as a creation of a virtual
version of a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system, or
network resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization in cloud computing allows a provider to virtualize servers,
storage, or other physical hardware or data center resources, which can
then, in turn, allow them to provide numerous services such as
infrastructure, software, and platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical
instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and
organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage and
providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of Virtualization:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtualization-in-grid"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-in-grid">Virtualization in Grid</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whereas a grid has many systems in a network and hence multiple people can have ownership. Virtualization helps in providing cloud better security. Grid computing is more economical. It splits the work and distributes it over the network on computers increasing the efficiency as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization allows addressing multiple problems in Grid systems, such as
coping with the heterogeneity of Grid resources, the difference in software
stacks, and enhanced features in resource management such as more general
check pointing or migration models. Adopting virtualization in smart ways
gets us closer to real Grid computing with more ﬂexibility in the type of
applications and the resources to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grid computing enables the virtualization of distributed computing resources suchas processing, network bandwidth,and storage capacity to create a single system image, granting users and applications seamless access to vast IT capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtualization-in-cloud"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-in-cloud">Virtualization in Cloud</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization plays a very important role in the cloud computing
technology, normally in the cloud computing, users share the data present in
the clouds like application etc, but actually with the help of
virtualization users shares the Infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main usage of Virtualization Technology is to provide the applications
with the standard versions to their cloud users, suppose if the next version
of that application is released, then cloud provider has to provide the
latest version to their cloud users and practically it is possible because
it is more expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To overcome this problem we use basically virtualization technology, By
using virtualization, all severs and the software application which are
required by other cloud providers are maintained by the third party people,
and the cloud providers has to pay the money on monthly or annual basis.</p>

<h3 id="virtualization-and-cloud-security"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-and-cloud-security">Virtualization and Cloud Security.</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, is a collection of
security measures designed to protect cloud-based infrastructure,
applications, and data. These measures ensure user and device
authentication, data and resource access control, and data privacy
protection. They also support regulatory data compliance. Cloud security is
employed in cloud environments to protect a company's data from distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, hackers, and unauthorized user
access or use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of clouds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Public clouds:</strong> Public cloud services are hosted by third-party cloud
service providers. A company doesn't have to set up anything to use the
cloud, since the provider handles it all. Usually, clients can access a
provider's web services via web browsers. Security features, such as access
control, identity management, and authentication, are crucial to public
clouds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private clouds:</strong> Private clouds are typically more secure than public
clouds, as they're usually dedicated to a single group or user and rely on
that group or user's firewall. The isolated nature of these clouds helps
them stay secure from outside attacks since they're only accessible by one
organization. However, they still face security challenges from some
threats, such as social engineering and breaches. These clouds can also be
difficult to scale as your company's needs expand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid clouds:</strong> Hybrid clouds combine the scalability of public
clouds with the greater control over resources that private clouds offer.
These clouds connect multiple environments, such as a private cloud and a
public cloud, that can scale more easily based on demand. Successful hybrid
clouds allow users to access all their environments in a single integrated
content management platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud security is critical since most organizations are already using cloud
computing in one form or another. This high rate of adoption of public cloud
services is reflected in Gartner’s recent prediction that the worldwide
market for public cloud services will grow 23.1% in 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualized security, or security virtualization, refers to security
solutions that are software-based and designed to work within a virtualized
IT environment. This differs from traditional, hardware-based network
security, which is static and runs on devices such as traditional firewalls,
routers, and switches.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Anatomy of Cloud Computing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Provisioning and Configuration Module:</strong> It is the lowest level of
cloud and typically resides on bare hardware (as a firmware) or on the
top of the hypervisor layer. Its function is to abstract the underlying
hardware and provide a standard mechanism to spawn instance of virtual
machine on demand. It also handles the post-configuration of the
operating systems and applications residing on the VM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Optimization:</strong> This layer handles the monitoring of
all services, storage, networking and applications components in cloud.
Based on the statistics, it could perform routine functions that
optimize the behavior of the infrastructure components and provide
relevant data to the cloud administrator to further optimize the
configuration for maximum utilization and performance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metering and Chargeback:</strong> This layer provides functions to measure
the usage of resources in cloud. The metering module collects all the
utilization data per domain per use. This module gives the cloud
administrator enough data to measure ongoing utilization of resources
and to create invoices based on the usage on a periodic basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Orchestration is a central to cloud operations.
Orchestration converts requests from the service management layer and
the monitoring, chargeback modules to appropriate action item which are
then submitted to provisioning and configuration module for final
closure. Orchestration updates the CMDB in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration Management Database (CMDB):</strong> It is a central
configuration repository wherein all the meta data and configuration of
different modules, resources are kept and updated in the real-time
basis. The repository can then be accessed using standards protocols
like SOAP by third-party software and integration components. All
updates in CMDB happen in real time as requests get processed in cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Life cycle Management Layer (CLM):</strong> This layer handles the
coordination of all other layers in cloud. All requests internal and
external are addressed to the CLM layer first. CLM may internally route
requests and actions to other layers for further processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Catalog:</strong> It is central to the definition of cloud, SC
defines what kind of services the cloud is capable of providing and at
what cost to the end user. SC is the first thing that is drafted before
a cloud is architecture. The service management layer consults SC before
it processes any request for a new resource.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-infrastructures"><a class="header" href="#virtual-infrastructures">Virtual infrastructures</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A virtual infrastructure allows you to utilise the IT capabilities of
physical resources as software that can be used across multiple platforms.
These resources are shared across multiple virtual machines (VMs) and
applications for maximum efficiency, creating a virtual infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits of virtual infrastructure</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> By consolidating servers, virtualization reduces
capital and operating costs associated with variables such as electrical
power, physical security, hosting and server development.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> A virtual infrastructure allows organizations to react
quickly to changing customer demands and market trends by ramping up on
CPU utilization or scaling back accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Increased productivity:</strong> Faster provisioning of applications and
resources allows IT teams to respond more quickly to employee demands
for new tools and technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified server management:</strong> Simplified server management makes
sure IT teams can spin up, or down, virtual machines when required and
re-provision resources based on real-time needs.</li>

<h3 id="cpu-virtualization"><a class="header" href="#cpu-virtualization">CPU Virtualization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization is a hardware feature found in all current AMD &amp; Intel
CPUs that allows a single processor to act as if it was multiple individual
CPUs.This allows an operating system to more effectively &amp; efficiently
utilize the CPU power in the computer so that it runs faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization emphasizes performance, running apps/programs, and runs
directly on the processor whenever possible. All operations are controlled
by an emulator that controls software to run accordingly, CPU Virtualisation
is not the same as emulation. The emulator works the same as a normal
computer machine does, it makes a copy of data and generates the same output
as a physical machine does. The emulation function gives a feeling of
working on multiple platforms while being on a single platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization helps all the virtual machines to behave like physical
machines and distribute their physical resources like virtual machines
sharing their physical memories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization improves performance and efficiency to a greater extent
because virtual machines work on a single CPU, sharing resources is actually
like using multiple processors at the same time. This saves Cost and Money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of CPU Virtualization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware-assisted CPU Virtualization :</strong> Hardware supports CPU
Virtualization through certain processors like Guest User. This Uses
different versions of code and the mode is known as a Guest mode. The best
part of hardware-assisted CPU Virtualization is, it doesn’t need any
translation while we use it for Hardware assistance. In short, it uplifts
system calls and makes them run faster than expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software-based CPU Virtualization :</strong> This type of CPU Virtualization
is software-based and it helps application code to get executed on a
processor. First, the privileged code gets translated, and then translated
code is directly executed on the processor. This translation process is
known as Binary Translation. The translated code is slow in execution and is
very large at the same time. Guest programs that are programmed in
privileged coding run very smoothly and fast. Applications with privileged
coding would run slower comparatively in a virtual environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtualization and Processor-Specific behavior:</strong> Although this
software virtualizes the CPU, the virtual machine can detect the model of a
processor on which it is running, processor models may differ in CPU
features they offer and applications running on these CPUs may use these
features. Therefore it is not possible to use v motion to transfer virtual
machines running on processors with different feature sets.</p>

<p><strong>Data Management and Data Transfer:</strong> To run HPC applications in the AWS
cloud, you need to move the required data into the cloud. There are several data
transport solutions designed to securely transfer huge amounts of data. This
overcomes issues like a long time for transfer, high network costs, and security
concerns. Also, you can automate the movement of data between the AWS cloud and
on-premises storage. There are options for establishing a private connection to
the AWS from your premises. This increases bandwidth to provide more throughput,
reduces the cost of the network, and provides a consistent network experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compute &amp; Networking:</strong> There are several compute instances types that can
be customized according to your needs. It also handles monitoring your

<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing
platform, Amazon Web Services, that allows users to rent virtual computers
on which to run their own computer applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EC2 refers to an on-demand computing service on the AWS cloud platform.
Under computing, it includes all the services a computing device can offer
to you along with the flexibility of a virtual environment. It also allows
the user to configure their instances as per their requirements i.e.
allocate the RAM, ROM, and storage according to the need of the current
task. Even the user can dismantle the virtual device once its task is
completed and it is no more required. For providing, all these scalable
resources AWS charges some bill amount at the end of every month, bill
amount is entirely dependent on your usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features of Amazon EC2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> EC2 provides its users a true virtual computing
platform, where they can various operations and even launch another EC2
instance from this virtually created environment. This will increase the
security of these virtual devices. Not only creating but also EC2 allows
us to customize our environment as per our requirements, at any point of
time during the life span of this virtual machine. Amazon EC2 itself
comes with a set of default AMI(Amazon Machine Image) options supporting
various operating systems along with some pre-configured resources like
RAM, ROM, storage, etc. Besides these AMI options, we can also create an
AMI curated with the combination of default and user-defined
configurations. And for future purposes, we can store this user-defined
AMI, so that next time, the user won’t have to re-configure a new AMI
from scratch. Rather than this whole process, the user can simply use
the older reference while creating a new EC2 machine.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Amazon EC2 includes a wide range of operating
systems to choose from while selecting your AMI. Not only these selected
options, but users are also even given the privileges to upload their
own operating systems and opt for that while selecting AMI during
launching an EC2 instance. Currently, AWS has the following most
preferred set of operating systems available on the EC2 console.
<ul>
<li>Amazon Linux</li>
<li>Windows Server</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>SUSE Linux</li>
<li>Red Hat Linux</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> Amazon is single-handedly ruling the cloud computing market,
because of the variety of options available on it for its users. It allows
its users to choose from various software present to run on their EC2
machines. This whole service is allocated to AWS Marketplace on the AWS
platform. Numerous software like SAP, LAMP and Drupal, etc are available on
AWS to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability and Reliability:</strong> EC2 provides us the facility to scale up or
scale down as per the needs. All dynamic scenarios can easily be tackled by
EC2 with the help of this feature. And because of the flexibility of volumes
and snapshots, it is highly reliable for its users. Due to the scalable
nature of the machine, many organizations like Flipkart, Amazon rely on days
whenever humongous traffic occurs on their portals.</p>

nurses, and care-givers that, too, in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Healthcare data needs to stay confidential. The abundant data
held by this domain makes it a focal point of attraction to the malicious
actors, resulting in security and data breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Cloud can hold an enormous amount of information at a very minimal
cost. Cloud computing works on the pay-as-you-go and subscription model,
which indicates you only have to pay for those services which you are
availing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Cloud-based tools can update and upgrade their features at a
commendable pace with minimal intervention, and you can get real-time updates
as well on all the relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Cloud facilitates technologies that are used
in healthcare like electronic medical records, mobile apps, patient portals,
devices with IoT, big data analytics.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ECG analysis in cloud computing</strong>: cloud computing technologies allows the
remote monitoring of a patient's heart beat data. Through this way the
patient at risk can be constantly monitored without going to the hospital
for ECG analysis. At the same time the Doctor's can instantly be notified
with cases that need's their attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ECG is just a visual image of a record of the electrical activity of the
heart muscle as it varies over time, typically printed on paper for easier
study. Similarly, like other muscles, the heart contracts in response to
electrical depolarization caused in the muscle cells. When it's the time of
day, it's the amount of the electrical activity, when amplified and registered
for just a few seconds that we call a heart rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With ECG data collection and tracking, it's possible to test for chest pain,
low-grade heart rhythm disturbances, arrhythmias, and more. An E-G
(electrocardiogram) is the electrical expression of the contractile movement
of the myocardium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since cloud computing systems are now readily available and deliver the
services in less time, it's got the promise to be a massive disruptor to
how the technology is distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence, the doctor doesn't need to put a huge effort into
computing, since there is a lot of software on which to run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud infrastructure is highly scalable; it can be maximized and
minimized according to the needs of each user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud computing (or cloud computing) systems are now available and aim
to provide reliable services to consumers with less time.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A protein is composed of long chains of amino acids joined together by
peptide bonds. The various structures of protein help in the designing of
new drugs and the various sequences of proteins from its three-dimensional
structure in predictive form is known as a Protein structure prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly primary structures of proteins are formed and then prediction of the
secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures are done from the primary one.
In this way predictions of protein structures are done. Protein structure
prediction also makes use of various other technologies like artificial
neural networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning and probabilistic
techniques, also holds great importance in fields like theoretical chemistry
and bioinformatics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are various algorithms and tools that exists for protein structure
prediction. CASP (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) is a
well-known tool that provides methods for automated web servers and the
results of research work are placed on clouds like CAMEO (Continuous
Automated Model Evaluation) server. These servers can be accessed by anyone
as per their requirements from any place. Some of the tools or servers used
in protein structure prediction are Phobius, FoldX, LOMETS, Prime, Predict
protein, SignalP, BBSP, EVfold, Biskit, HHpred, Phre, ESyired3D. Using these
tools new structures are predicted and the results are placed on the

artificial satellites. Firstly, the photographs are taken in digital form
and later are processed by the computers to extract the information.
Statistical methods are applied to the digital images and after processing
the various discrete surfaces are identified by analyzing the pixel values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Majorly there are four kinds of resolutions associated with satellite
imagery. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial resolution:</strong> It is determined by the sensors Instantaneous
Field of View(IFoV) and is defined as the pixel size of an image that is
visible to the human eye being measured on the ground. Since it has high
resolving power or the ability to separate and hence is termed as
Spatial Resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral resolution:</strong> This resolution measures the wavelength
internal size and determines the number of wavelength intervals that the
sensor measures.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal resolution:</strong> The word temporal is associated with time or
days and is defined as the time that passes between various imagery
cloud periods.</li>
<li><strong>Radiometric resolution:</strong> This resolution provides the actual
characteristics of the image and is generally expressed in bits size. It
gives the effective bit depth and records the various levels of
brightness of imaging system.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Social networks help boost internet usability by storing heavy multimedia
content in cloud storage systems. Videos and photographs are the most
popular content on social media, which essentially use up the maximum space
allocated to them. They have the capacity to slow down applications and
servers with all of their resource demands. Cloud computing vendors such as
Salesforce and Amazon nowadays provide varied services including Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). As
they deliver these things through cloud servers, clients can use the
flexibility and scalability of the system without purchasing standalone
software or hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from data storage, the social networks are now also using clouds for
various other tasks. For example, this can be ideal for big data analytics.
One of the benefits of using cloud systems is that users can access vast
amount of structured and even non-structured data easily. Just take a look
at the much-improved analytics provided by sites like Facebook, especially
for its business users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way cloud computing becomes helpful is by reducing the cost of data
backup and recovery in case of a disaster. If the data is only stored in one
central location, it becomes much riskier. If something happens there, it is
almost impossible to recover the data. But through cloud they remain
accessible through shared resources across the globe. This is especially
useful for social networks as the store personal data of its users, and so
cannot afford to lose even one part of it.</p>

<p>The risk-based approach of managing information systems is a holistic
activity that needs to be fully integrated into every aspect of the
organization, from planning to system development life cycle processes, to
security controls allocation and continuous monitoring. Therefore, a Risk
Management Framework (RMF) provides a disciplined and structured process
that integrates information security and risk management activities into the
system development life cycle. An RMF operates primarily at tier 3 in the
risk management hierarchy, but it can also have interactions at tier 1 and

<h3 id="types-of-risks-in-cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#types-of-risks-in-cloud-computing">Types of Risks in Cloud Computing</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of cloud
computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process in which
data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user, software, or
application. In a cloud computing environment, data loss occurs when our
sensitive data is somebody else's hands, one or more data elements can not be
utilized by the data owner, hard disk is not working properly, and software is
not updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs:</strong> As we all know, cloud computing is
completely depends on Internet, so it is compulsory to protect interfaces and
APIs that are used by external users. APIs are the easiest way to communicate
with most of the cloud services. In cloud computing, few services are available
in the public domain. These services can be accessed by third parties, so there
may be a chance that these services easily harmed and hacked by hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Data Breach is the process in which the confidential data
is viewed, accessed, or stolen by the third party without any authorization, so
organization's data is hacked by the hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Vendor lock-in is the of the biggest security risks in
cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their
services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different
platforms, that can cause difficulty moving one cloud to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased complexity strains IT staff:</strong> Migrating, integrating, and
operating the cloud services is complex for the IT staff. IT staff must require
the extra capability and skills to manage, integrate, and maintain the data to
the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectre &amp; Meltdown:</strong> Spectre &amp; Meltdown allows programs to view and steal
data which is currently processed on computer. It can run on personal computers,
mobile devices, and in the cloud. It can store the password, your personal
information such as images, emails, and business documents in the memory of
other running programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Denial of service (DoS) attacks occur
when the system receives too much traffic to buffer the server. Mostly, DoS
attackers target web servers of large organizations such as banking sectors,
media companies, and government organizations. To recover the lost data, DoS
attackers charge a great deal of time and money to handle the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account hijacking:</strong> Account hijacking is a serious security risk in cloud
computing. It is the process in which individual user's or organization's cloud
account (bank account, e-mail account, and social media account) is stolen by
hackers. The hackers use the stolen account to perform unauthorized activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-security-in-cloud"><a class="header" href="#data-security-in-cloud">Data Security in Cloud</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The three letters in &quot;CIA triad&quot; stand for Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability. The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis for the
development of security systems. They are used for finding vulnerabilities
and methods for creating solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core principles of information security and data governance—data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (known as the CIA triad)—also
apply to the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> protecting the data from unauthorized access and
disclosure</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> safeguard the data from unauthorized modification so it
can be trusted</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> ensuring the data is fully available and accessible
when it’s needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MORE DETAILED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Confidentiality involves the efforts of an organization
to make sure data is kept secret or private. To accomplish this, access to
information must be controlled to prevent the unauthorized sharing of
data—whether intentional or accidental. A key component of maintaining
confidentiality is making sure that people without proper authorization are
prevented from accessing assets important to your business. Conversely, an
effective system also ensures that those who need to have access have the
necessary privileges.</p>
<p>For example, those who work with an organization’s finances should be able
to access the spreadsheets, bank accounts, and other information related to
the flow of money. However, the vast majority of other employees—and perhaps
even certain executives—may not be granted access. To ensure these policies
are followed, stringent restrictions have to be in place to limit who can
see what.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> Integrity involves making sure your data is trustworthy and
free from tampering. The integrity of your data is maintained only if the
data is authentic, accurate, and reliable.</p>
<p>For example, if your company provides information about senior managers on
your website, this information needs to have integrity. If it is inaccurate,
those visiting the website for information may feel your organization is not
trustworthy. Someone with a vested interest in damaging the reputation of
your organization may try to hack your website and alter the descriptions,
photographs, or titles of the executives to hurt their reputation or that of
the company as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity
maintained, it is often useless unless it is available to those in the
organization and the customers they serve. This means that systems,
networks, and applications must be functioning as they should and when they
should. Also, individuals with access to specific information must be able
to consume it when they need to, and getting to the data should not take an
inordinate amount of time.</p>
<p>If, for example, there is a power outage and there is no disaster recovery
system in place to help users regain access to critical systems,
availability will be compromised. Also, a natural disaster like a flood or
even a severe snowstorm may prevent users from getting to the office, which
can interrupt the availability of their workstations and other devices that
provide business-critical information or applications. Availability can also
be compromised through deliberate acts of sabotage, such as the use of
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or ransomware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-issues"><a class="header" href="#security-issues">Security Issues</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data Loss is one of the issues faced in Cloud Computing. This
is also known as Data Leakage. As we know that our sensitive data is in the
hands of Somebody else, and we don’t have full control over our database. So if
the security of cloud service is to break by hackers then it may be possible
that hackers will get access to our sensitive data or personal files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interference of Hackers and Insecure API’s:</strong> As we know if we are talking
about the cloud and its services it means we are talking about the Internet.
Also, we know that the easiest way to communicate with Cloud is using API. So it
is important to protect the Interface’s and API’s which are used by an external
user. But also in cloud computing, few services are available in the public
domain. An is the vulnerable part of Cloud Computing because it may be possible
that these services are accessed by some third parties. So it may be possible
that with the help of these services hackers can easily hack or harm our data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Account Hijacking:</strong> Account Hijacking is the most serious security
issue in Cloud Computing. If somehow the Account of User or an Organization is
hijacked by Hacker. Then the hacker has full authority to perform Unauthorized
Activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Service Provider:</strong> Vendor lock In is also an important Security
issue in Cloud Computing. Many organizations will face different problems while
shifting from one vendor to another. For example, An Organization wants to shift
from AWS Cloud to Google Cloud Services then they ace various problem’s like
shifting of all data, also both cloud services have different techniques and
functions, so they also face problems regarding that. Also, it may be possible
that the charges of AWS are different from Google Cloud, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Skill:</strong> While working, shifting o another service provider, need
an extra feature, how to use a feature, etc. are the main problems caused in IT
Company who doesn’t have skilled Employee. So it requires a skilled person to
work with cloud Computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack:</strong> This type of attack occurs when the
system receives too much traffic. Mostly DoS attacks occur in large
organizations such as the banking sector, government sector, etc. When a DoS
attack occurs data is lost. So in order to recover data, it requires a great
amount of money as well as time to handle it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges"><a class="header" href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DDoS and Denial-of-Service Attacks:</strong> As more and more businesses and
operations move to the cloud, cloud providers are becoming a bigger target for
malicious attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are more common
than ever before. Verisign reported IT services, cloud platforms (PaaS) and SaaS
was the most frequently targeted industry during the first quarter of 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data breaches:</strong> Known data breaches in the U.S. hit a record-high of 738
in 2014, according to the Identity Theft Research Center, and hacking was (by
far) the number one cause. That’s an incredible statistic and only emphasizes
the growing challenge to secure sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data loss:</strong> When business critical information is moved into the cloud,
it’s understandable to be concerned with its security. Losing cloud data, either
through accidental deletion and human error, malicious tampering including the
installation of malware (i.e. DDoS), or an act of nature that brings down a
cloud service provider, could be disastrous for an enterprise business. Often a
DDoS attack is only a diversion for a greater threat, such as an attempt to
steal or delete data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure access control points:</strong> One of the great benefits of the cloud
is it can be accessed from anywhere and from any device. But, what if the
interfaces and particularly the application programming interfaces (APIs) users
interact with aren’t secure? Hackers can find and gain access to these types of
vulnerabilities and exploit authentication via APIs if given enough time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifications and alerts:</strong> Awareness and proper communication of security
threats is a cornerstone of network security and the same goes for cloud
computing security. Alerting the appropriate website or application managers as
soon as a threat is identified should be part of a thorough data security and
access management plan. Speedy mitigation of a threat relies on clear and prompt
communication so steps can be taken by the proper entities and impact of the
threat minimized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages"><a class="header" href="#advantages">Advantages</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>24×7 Visibility:</strong> The best cloud security solutions like AppTrana enable
24×7 monitoring of the application and cloud-based assets. This helps
organizations to have continuous visibility into their risk posture and its
impact on the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher Availability:</strong> Cloud computing security solutions typically have
built-in redundancies to ensure that the application/ resources are always
available. The CDNs used have distributed global networks of edge servers that
deliver content optimally, accelerate application performance, and minimize
access to the server. Together, they handle traffic surges in a way that
on-premises/ hardware solutions cannot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effective protection against DDoS Attacks:</strong> Cloud security solutions
provide the most effective protection against DDoS attacks, which are increasing
in numbers, magnitude, sophistication, and severity. Cloud computing security
helps to continuously monitor, identify, analyze, and mitigate DDoS attacks. The
built-in redundancies, customizability, flexibility, scalability, and
intelligence of such solutions can prevent volumetric, low, and slow attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Security:</strong> The best cloud computing security solutions provide data
security by design. They have security protocols and policies such as strong
access controls and data encryption to prevent unauthorized entities from
accessing confidential information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay as you Go Model:</strong> The cloud security model ensures that you pay only
for what you use and consume as opposed to making any upfront investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced Threat Detection:</strong> By using end-point scanning and global threat
intelligence, cloud computing security can detect threats more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Top-notch cloud application security providers
help to ensure regulatory standards and industry-specific compliance needs. This
is done through its enhanced infrastructure and managed security services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages">Disadvantages</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of data confidentiality:</strong> There is always a risk that user data can
be accessed by other people. So data and cloud protection must be good because
if it won’t be dangerous for data confidentiality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depends on internet connection:</strong> The internet is the only way to cloud
computing. When there is no internet connection in your place, or the internet
path to the cloud provider is in trouble, automatically access to your cloud
computing machine will be disconnected. Now this is where the biggest obstacle
is happening in developing countries and remote areas that do not have good
internet access.And the weakness of public cloud is where everyone accesses the
same server and server and will increase the risk of attack, and down the
server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The level of security:</strong> Secrecy and security are among the most doubtful
things in cloud computing. By using a cloud computing system means we are fully
entrusted with the security and confidentiality of data to companies that
provide cloud computing servers. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue
the server for errors in the data. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue
the server for errors in the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance:</strong> Which refers to the risk of a level compliance deviation
from the provider against the regulations applied by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerable in the event of an attack:</strong> There are lots of arguments
against cloud computing one of which is computing because the Cloud Computing
work system is online, each component that is on Cloud Computing can be exposed
to a wide range, this is a wide open opportunity for attacks on data or
activities stored on the server. When an attack is carried out by hackers, the
problems that occur are data security, and data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Mobility:</strong> which refers to the possibility of sharing data between
cloud services and how to retrieve data if one day the user makes a process of
terminating cloud computing services.And there is local storage where the data
can be used at any time as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical problem:</strong> Besides that the use of Cloud Computing makes you
unable to manage it yourself when there is a problem or a problem, you must
contact customer support who is not necessarily ready 24/7. This is a problem
because for some support you also have to pay more money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low Connection:</strong> Does not work well if the connection is slow. The
quality of cloud computing servers is one of the most important considerations
before we decide to provide cloud computing server service providers. When the
server is down or the permorma is not good, we will be harmed because of poor
server quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> Protect the data from the unauthorized insert, update, or
delete. The data owner and authorized users should be able to recognize if
the data is corrupted or incomplete, and receive the most recent updated
version of the data, which guarantees accuracy and consistency of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> The data in the cloud servers should be accessible to its
users. Major threats to availability are denial of service (DOS) attacks,
natural disasters, and equipment failures at the service provider’s end.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="security-authorization-challenges-in-the-cloud"><a class="header" href="#security-authorization-challenges-in-the-cloud">Security Authorization Challenges in the Cloud</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Consequences of a data breach may include: Data breaches
put classified data at risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misconfiguration and Inadequate Change Control:</strong> This is one of the most
common challenges of the cloud. In 2017, a misconfigured AWS Simple Storage
Service (S3) cloud storage bucket exposed detailed and private data of 123
million American households.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Cloud Security Architecture and Strategy:</strong> One of the biggest
challenges is the implementation of appropriate security architecture to
withstand cyberattacks. Unfortunately, this process is still a mystery for
many organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient Identity, Credential, Access and Key Management:</strong> In both
public and private cloud settings, CSPs and cloud consumers are required to
manage IAM without compromising security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account Hijacking:</strong> Account hijacking is a threat in which malicious
attackers gain access to and abuse accounts that are highly privileged or
sensitive. In cloud environments, the accounts with the highest risks are
cloud service accounts or subscriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insider Threat:</strong> Insider negligence is the cause of most security
incidents. Employee or contractor negligence was the root cause of most of
the reported insider incidents. Some common scenarios cited include:
misconfigured cloud servers, employees storing sensitive company data on
their own insecure personal devices and systems, and employees or other
insiders falling prey to phishing emails that led to malicious attacks on
company assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Interfaces and APIs:</strong>  Poorly designed APIs could lead to misuse
or—even worse—a data breach. Broken, exposed, or hacked APIs have caused
some major data breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited Cloud Usage Visibility:</strong> Limited cloud usage visibility occurs
when an organization does not possess the ability to visualize and analyze
whether cloud service use within the organization is safe or malicious. This
scenario results in a self-support model called Shadow IT. one-third of all
successful security attacks on companies will come through shadow IT systems
and resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="secure-cloud-software-requirements"><a class="header" href="#secure-cloud-software-requirements">Secure Cloud Software Requirements</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-of-the-Line Perimeter Firewall:</strong> Most firewalls are very simple—they
typically inspect a packet’s source and destination and that’s all. Some more
advanced firewalls feature stable packet inspection, which checks the integrity
of the file packets for stability issues prior to approving or rejecting the
packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems with Event Logging:</strong> Numerous IT security
compliance standards require businesses to have a means of tracking and
recording intrusion attempts. So, for any business that wants to meet compliance
standards such as PCI or HIPAA, using IDS event logging solutions is a must.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Firewalls for Individual Applications, and Databases:</strong> While
having a strong perimeter firewall can block external attacks, internal attacks
are still a major threat. Infrastructures that lack internal firewalls to
restrict access to sensitive data and applications cannot be considered secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data-at-Rest Encryption:</strong> Encrypting the data that is stored on your
cloud infrastructure can be an effective way to keep your most sensitive
information from being accessed by the wrong party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tier IV Data Centers with Strong Physical Security:</strong> The physical
hardware used to run a cloud environment represents one last opportunity for
hackers and industrial spies to steal your most important data. When allowed
direct access to the hardware that runs the cloud, hackers have free reign to
steal data or upload malware directly to your systems.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid/ Multi-Cloud Solutions:</strong> Hybrid cloud computing refers to using a
combination of the private cloud as well as a third-party public cloud
service. It is primarily used to allow workloads to move between private and
public clouds, giving users more flexibility with their computing needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup And Disaster Recovery:</strong> Cyber attacks, data outages, and system
failures are a part and parcel of running a business these days. Most
businesses have dealt with their servers crashing, leading to loss of
critical data files. To ensure such issues don’t damage the organization and
its processes, backup and disaster recovery has become a trending use case
of the cloud. If Spiceworks reports are to be believed, 15% of the cloud
budget is allocated to Backup and Disaster Recovery, which is the highest
budget allocation followed by email hosting and productivity tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> A serverless architecture removes all barriers
that a standard IT infrastructure would usually bring. Users don’t have to
purchase or rent the servers that they run their data on. Instead, a
third-party will handle it all for you, allowing your organization to tackle
other tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Platform:</strong> As technology advances, one of the most common cloud
computing trends to look forward to is AI. Tech giants are now looking into
incorporating AI to process big data to improve their business functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Data theft, leakage, and deletion- security is a big
challenge even for traditional IT infrastructures. But, with more companies
moving to cloud platforms, it’s important to ensure that cloud service
providers can create an airtight security system to guarantee the safety of
their client’s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Platform:</strong> With a hyper-connected world, one of the most popular
cloud computing trends is the rise of IoT platforms. A study by Gartner
suggests the number of connected things in use will be going up to 25
billion by 2021 from 14.2 billion as of 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> It is a method of optimizing cloud computing network
system by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the
source of the data. It works real-time on the cloud servers to process less
time-sensitive data or store data for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevSecOps:</strong> Cloud computing services provide users with a seamless and
simple experience in managing their data but there are many security risks
involved.  The security risk of cloud computing includes network
eavesdropping, illegal invasion, denial of service attacks, side channel
attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Mesh:</strong> Since cloud platforms are complex, it is critical to
ensure that the platform has a fast and safe communication environment. With
a service mesh, users have a dedicated layer for service-to-service
communication, making their cloud platform highly dynamic and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> This industry is moving towards a path of innovation and
collaboration. With this shift in how cloud services are managed, many
organizations are looking at adopting an Open Source cloud computing service
for their business.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary
elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the
operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public
cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources
at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in
which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they
actually run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits Of Containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of responsibility:</strong> Containerization provides a clear
separation of responsibility, as developers focus on application logic
and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and
management instead of application details such as specific software
versions and configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workload portability:</strong> Containers can run virtually anywhere, greatly
easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
systems; on virtual machines or on physical servers; on a developer’s
machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the public
cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application isolation:</strong> Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage,

<p><strong>Explain CPU virtualization in detail.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization is a hardware feature found in all current AMD &amp;
Intel CPUs that allows a single processor to act as if it was multiple
individual CPUs.This allows an operating system to more effectively &amp;
efficiently utilize the CPU power in the computer so that it runs
faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization improves performance and efficiency to a greater
extent because virtual machines work on a single CPU, sharing resources
is actually like using multiple processors at the same time. This saves
Cost and Money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of CPU Virtualization</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware-assisted CPU Virtualization :</strong> Hardware supports CPU
Virtualization through certain processors like Guest User. This Uses
different versions of code and the mode is known as a Guest mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software-based CPU Virtualization :</strong> This type of CPU
Virtualization is software-based and it helps application code to get
executed on a processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtualization and Processor-Specific behavior:</strong> Although this
software virtualizes the CPU, the virtual machine can detect the model
of a processor on which it is running, processor models may differ in
CPU features they offer and applications running on these CPUs may use
these features.</p>

<p><strong>Explain in detail Amazon Web Services &amp; its components.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides
on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies,
and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing
web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and
software tools via AWS server farms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly
adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from
data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the
fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government
agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate
faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Management and Data Transfer:</strong> To run HPC applications in
the AWS cloud, you need to move the required data into the cloud. There
are several data transport solutions designed to securely transfer huge
amounts of data. This overcomes issues like a long time for transfer,
high network costs, and security concerns. Also, you can automate the
movement of data between the AWS cloud and on-premises storage. There
are options for establishing a private connection to the AWS from your
premises. This increases bandwidth to provide more throughput, reduces
the cost of the network, and provides a consistent network experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compute &amp; Networking:</strong> There are several compute instances types
that can be customized according to your needs. It also handles
monitoring your application and adjusting its capacity for maintaining a
steady and predictable performance at an affordable cost. Also, setting
up application scaling across multiple services for multiple resources
takes a few minutes. Enhanced networking options from AWS allow
achieving lower inter-instance latency and higher bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> When looking for an HPC solution, you need to consider
the storage options and cost. There are several flexible blocks, object,
and file storage options in AWS services that allow permanent and
transient data storage. It allows allocating storage volumes according
to the size you need. You can store and access and data type over the
cloud without doing a data migration project. Also, with AWS services,
you can transfer your workload to the cloud from on-premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation and Orchestration:</strong> For using the infrastructure
efficiently, you need to automate scheduling submitted jobs and the job
submission process. AWS services allow you to run thousands of batch
computing jobs through the dynamic provision of the computer resources
on the basis of the requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operations and Management:</strong> As a system administrator, you are
responsible for avoiding cost overruns and monitoring the
infrastructure. There are several management and monitoring services
that allow you to optimize utilization of resources, monitor the
application, get a complete view of operational health, and respond to
the performance changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visualization:</strong> With the AWS services, you can easily visualize
the engineering simulations’ results without moving huge amounts of
data. Now, you can access the interactive applications remotely over a
standard network and deliver application sessions to any workstation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> For running applications on the cloud,
you need to have an understanding of regulatory compliance and security
management. There are several quick-launch templates and security
related services offered by AWS that helps in protecting data and
customer privacy by putting strong safeguards in the AWS
infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Explain in detail Elastic Cloud Computing(EC2).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing
platform, Amazon Web Services, that allows users to rent virtual computers
on which to run their own computer applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features of Amazon EC2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> EC2 provides its users a true virtual computing
platform, where they can various operations and even launch another
EC2 instance from this virtually created environment. This will
increase the security of these virtual devices. Not only creating
but also EC2 allows us to customize our environment as per our
requirements, at any point of time during the life span of this
virtual machine. Amazon EC2 itself comes with a set of default
AMI(Amazon Machine Image) options supporting various operating
systems along with some pre-configured resources like RAM, ROM,
storage, etc. Besides these AMI options, we can also create an AMI
curated with the combination of default and user-defined
configurations. And for future purposes, we can store this
user-defined AMI, so that next time, the user won’t have to
re-configure a new AMI from scratch. Rather than this whole process,
the user can simply use the older reference while creating a new EC2
machine.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Amazon EC2 includes a wide range of operating
systems to choose from while selecting your AMI. Not only these
selected options, but users are also even given the privileges to
upload their own operating systems and opt for that while selecting
AMI during launching an EC2 instance. Currently, AWS has the
following most preferred set of operating systems available on the
EC2 console.
<ul>
<li>Amazon Linux</li>
<li>Windows Server</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Cloud computing in healthcare describes the practice of
implementing remote servers accessed via the internet to store, manage
and process healthcare-related data. This is in contrast to establishing
an on-site data center with servers, or hosting the data on a personal
computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ECG Analysis in the cloud:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ECG analysis in cloud computing</strong>: cloud computing
technologies allows the remote monitoring of a patient's heart
beat data. Through this way the patient at risk can be
constantly monitored without going to the hospital for ECG
analysis. At the same time the Doctor's can instantly be
notified with cases that need's their attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ECG is just a visual image of a record of the electrical
activity of the heart muscle as it varies over time, typically
printed on paper for easier study. Similarly, like other
muscles, the heart contracts in response to electrical
depolarization caused in the muscle cells. When it's the time of
day, it's the amount of the electrical activity, when amplified
and registered for just a few seconds that we call a heart
rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With ECG data collection and tracking, it's possible to test for
chest pain, low-grade heart rhythm disturbances, arrhythmias,
and more. An E-G (electrocardiogram) is the electrical
expression of the contractile movement of the myocardium.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biology:</strong> Cloud computing is an emerging technology that provides
various computing services on demand. It provides convenient access to a
shared pool of higher-level services and other system resources.
Nowadays, cloud computing has a great significance in the fields of
geology, biology, and other scientific research areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Protein Structure Prediction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protein structure prediction is the best example in research
area that makes use of cloud applications for its computation
and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A protein is composed of long chains of amino acids joined
together by peptide bonds. The various structures of protein
help in the designing of new drugs and the various sequences of
proteins from its three-dimensional structure in predictive form
is known as a Protein structure prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly primary structures of proteins are formed and then
prediction of the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures
are done from the primary one. In this way predictions of
protein structures are done. Protein structure prediction also
makes use of various other technologies like artificial neural
networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning and
probabilistic techniques, also holds great importance in fields
like theoretical chemistry and bioinformatics.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Explain different types of risks in cloud computing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In many ways, the security threats facing today’s traditional data
center environments overlap with those of a cloud computing environment.
On both sides, cybercriminals aim to take advantage of vulnerabilities
found in software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several security risks to consider when making the switch to
cloud computing. Here are 5 of the top security risks your organization
should be aware of:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of
cloud computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process
in which data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user,
software, or application. In a cloud computing environment, data loss occurs
when our sensitive data is somebody else's hands, one or more data elements
can not be utilized by the data owner, hard disk is not working properly,
and software is not updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs:</strong> As we all know, cloud computing
is completely depends on Internet, so it is compulsory to protect interfaces
and APIs that are used by external users. APIs are the easiest way to
communicate with most of the cloud services. In cloud computing, few
services are available in the public domain. These services can be accessed
by third parties, so there may be a chance that these services easily harmed
and hacked by hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Data Breach is the process in which the confidential
data is viewed, accessed, or stolen by the third party without any
authorization, so organization's data is hacked by the hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Vendor lock-in is the of the biggest security risks
in cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their
services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different
platforms, that can cause difficulty moving one cloud to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased complexity strains IT staff:</strong> Migrating, integrating, and
operating the cloud services is complex for the IT staff. IT staff must
require the extra capability and skills to manage, integrate, and maintain
the data to the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectre &amp; Meltdown:</strong> Spectre &amp; Meltdown allows programs to view and
steal data which is currently processed on computer. It can run on personal
computers, mobile devices, and in the cloud. It can store the password, your
personal information such as images, emails, and business documents in the
memory of other running programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Denial of service (DoS) attacks
occur when the system receives too much traffic to buffer the server.
Mostly, DoS attackers target web servers of large organizations such as
banking sectors, media companies, and government organizations. To recover
the lost data, DoS attackers charge a great deal of time and money to handle
the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account hijacking:</strong> Account hijacking is a serious security risk in
cloud computing. It is the process in which individual user's or
organization's cloud account (bank account, e-mail account, and social media
account) is stolen by hackers. The hackers use the stolen account to perform
unauthorized activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain in detail cloud security services:</strong> <em>Confidentiality,</em>
<em>Integrity, &amp;</em> <em>Availability</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The three letters in &quot;CIA triad&quot; stand for Confidentiality, Integrity,
and Availability. The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis
for the development of security systems. They are used for finding
vulnerabilities and methods for creating solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core principles of information security and data governance—data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (known as the CIA
triad)—also apply to the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> protecting the data from unauthorized access
and disclosure</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> safeguard the data from unauthorized modification so
it can be trusted</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> ensuring the data is fully available and
accessible when it’s needed</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Explain need of secure cloud software requirements.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need a secure way to immediately access your data. Cloud security
ensures your data and applications are readily available to authorized
users. You'll always have a reliable method to access your cloud
applications and information, helping you quickly take action on any
potential security issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure cloud software requirements:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-of-the-Line Perimeter Firewall:</strong> Most firewalls are very
simple—they typically inspect a packet’s source and destination and that’s
all. Some more advanced firewalls feature stable packet inspection, which
checks the integrity of the file packets for stability issues prior to
approving or rejecting the packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems with Event Logging:</strong> Numerous IT security
compliance standards require businesses to have a means of tracking and
recording intrusion attempts. So, for any business that wants to meet
compliance standards such as PCI or HIPAA, using IDS event logging solutions
is a must.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Firewalls for Individual Applications, and Databases:</strong> While
having a strong perimeter firewall can block external attacks, internal
attacks are still a major threat. Infrastructures that lack internal
firewalls to restrict access to sensitive data and applications cannot be
considered secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data-at-Rest Encryption:</strong> Encrypting the data that is stored on your
cloud infrastructure can be an effective way to keep your most sensitive
information from being accessed by the wrong party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tier IV Data Centers with Strong Physical Security:</strong> The physical
hardware used to run a cloud environment represents one last opportunity for
hackers and industrial spies to steal your most important data. When allowed
direct access to the hardware that runs the cloud, hackers have free reign
to steal data or upload malware directly to your systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain future trends in cloud computing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Future Trends in Cloud Computing</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid/ Multi-Cloud Solutions:</strong> Hybrid cloud computing refers to
using a combination of the private cloud as well as a third-party public
cloud service. It is primarily used to allow workloads to move between
private and public clouds, giving users more flexibility with their
computing needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup And Disaster Recovery:</strong> Cyber attacks, data outages, and
system failures are a part and parcel of running a business these days.
Most businesses have dealt with their servers crashing, leading to loss
of critical data files. To ensure such issues don’t damage the
organization and its processes, backup and disaster recovery has become
a trending use case of the cloud. If Spiceworks reports are to be
believed, 15% of the cloud budget is allocated to Backup and Disaster
Recovery, which is the highest budget allocation followed by email
hosting and productivity tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> A serverless architecture removes all
barriers that a standard IT infrastructure would usually bring. Users
don’t have to purchase or rent the servers that they run their data on.
Instead, a third-party will handle it all for you, allowing your
organization to tackle other tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Platform:</strong> As technology advances, one of the most common
cloud computing trends to look forward to is AI. Tech giants are now
looking into incorporating AI to process big data to improve their
business functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Data theft, leakage, and deletion- security is a
big challenge even for traditional IT infrastructures. But, with more
companies moving to cloud platforms, it’s important to ensure that cloud
service providers can create an airtight security system to guarantee
the safety of their client’s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Platform:</strong> With a hyper-connected world, one of the most
popular cloud computing trends is the rise of IoT platforms. A study by
Gartner suggests the number of connected things in use will be going up
to 25 billion by 2021 from 14.2 billion as of 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> It is a method of optimizing cloud computing
network system by performing data processing at the edge of the network,
near the source of the data. It works real-time on the cloud servers to
process less time-sensitive data or store data for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevSecOps:</strong> Cloud computing services provide users with a
seamless and simple experience in managing their data but there are many
security risks involved.  The security risk of cloud computing includes
network eavesdropping, illegal invasion, denial of service attacks, side
channel attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud
services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Mesh:</strong> Since cloud platforms are complex, it is critical
to ensure that the platform has a fast and safe communication
environment. With a service mesh, users have a dedicated layer for
service-to-service communication, making their cloud platform highly
dynamic and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> This industry is moving towards a path of
innovation and collaboration. With this shift in how cloud services are
managed, many organizations are looking at adopting an Open Source
cloud computing service for their business.</p>

<p><strong>Volume:</strong>	The amount of data matters. With big data, you’ll have to
process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. This can be data of
unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a web page or a
mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. For some organizations, this might
be tens of terabytes of data. For others, it may be hundreds of petabytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Velocity:</strong>	Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and
(perhaps) acted on. Normally, the highest velocity of data streams directly
into memory versus being written to disk. Some internet-enabled smart
products operate in real time or near real time and will require real-time
evaluation and action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variety:</strong>	Variety refers to the many types of data that are
available. Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a
relational database. With the rise of big data, data comes in new
unstructured data types. Unstructured and semistructured data types, such as
text, audio, and video, require additional preprocessing to derive meaning
and support metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Veracity:</strong> It refers to inconsistencies and uncertainty in data, that
is data which is available can sometimes get messy and quality and accuracy
are difficult to control. Big Data is also variable because of the multitude
of data dimensions resulting from multiple disparate data types and sources.
Example: Data in bulk could create confusion whereas less amount of data
could convey half or Incomplete Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> After having the 4 V’s into account there comes one more V
which stands for Value!. The bulk of Data having no Value is of no good to
the company, unless you turn it into something useful. Data in itself is of
no use or importance but it needs to be converted into something valuable to
extract Information. Hence, you can state that Value! is the most important
V of all the 5V’s.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big data benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big data makes it possible for you to gain more complete answers because
you have more information.</li>
<li>More complete answers mean more confidence in the data—which means a
completely different approach to tackling problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sources-of-big-data"><a class="header" href="#sources-of-big-data">Sources of Big Data</a></h2>
<p>The bulk of big data generated comes from three primary sources: social data,
machine data and transactional data. In addition, companies need to make the
distinction between data which is generated internally, that is to say it
resides behind a company’s firewall, and externally data generated which needs
to be imported into a system. Whether data is unstructured or structured is also
an important factor. Unstructured data does not have a pre-defined data model
and therefore requires more resources to make sense of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The three primary sources of  Big Data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Social data</strong> comes from the Likes, Tweets &amp; Retweets, Comments, Video
Uploads, and general media that are uploaded and shared via the world’s
favorite social media platforms. This kind of data provides invaluable
insights into consumer behavior and sentiment and can be enormously
influential in marketing analytics. The public web is another good
source of social data, and tools like Google Trends can be used to good
effect to increase the volume of big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine data</strong> is defined as information which is generated by
industrial equipment, sensors that are installed in machinery, and even
web logs which track user behavior. This type of data is expected to
grow exponentially as the internet of things grows ever more pervasive
and expands around the world. Sensors such as medical devices, smart
meters, road cameras, satellites, games and the rapidly growing Internet
Of Things will deliver high velocity, value, volume and variety of data
in the very near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transactional data</strong> is generated from all the daily transactions that
take place both online and offline. Invoices, payment orders, storage
records, delivery receipts – all are characterized as transactional data
yet data alone is almost meaningless, and most organizations struggle to
make sense of the data that they are generating and how it can be put to
good use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-analytic-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#data-analytic-lifecycle">Data Analytic Lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>The Data analytic lifecycle is designed for Big Data problems and data science
projects. The cycle is iterative to represent real project. To address the
distinct requirements for performing analysis on Big Data, step – by – step
methodology is needed to organize the activities and tasks involved with
acquiring, processing, analyzing, and repurposing data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are six phases in Data Analytics Lifecycle:</p>
<p><img src="pictures/phases.jpg" alt="Phases of Data Analytics Lifecycle" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> The data science team learn and investigate the problem.
Develop context and understanding. Come to know about data sources needed
and available for the project. The team formulates initial hypothesis that
can be later tested with data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Steps to explore, preprocess, and condition data
prior to modeling and analysis. It requires the presence of an analytic
sandbox, the team execute, load, and transform, to get data into the
sandbox. Data preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times
and not in predefined order. Several tools commonly used for this phase are
– Hadoop, Alpine Miner, Open Refine, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Model Planning:</strong> Team explores data to learn about relationships
between variables and subsequently, selects key variables and the most
suitable models. In this phase, data science team develop data sets for
training, testing, and production purposes. Team builds and executes models
based on the work done in the model planning phase. Several tools commonly
used for this phase are – Matlab, STASTICA.</li>
<li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Team develops datasets for testing, training, and
production purposes. Team also considers whether its existing tools will
suffice for running the models or if they need more robust environment for
executing models. Free or open-source tools – Rand PL/R, Octave, WEKA.
Commercial tools – Matlab , STASTICA.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Results:</strong> After executing model team need to compare
outcomes of modeling to criteria established for success and failure. Team
considers how best to articulate findings and outcomes to various team
members and stakeholders, taking into account warning, assumptions. Team
should identify key findings, quantify business value, and develop narrative
to summarize and convey findings to stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Operationalize:</strong> The team communicates benefits of project more
broadly and sets up pilot project to deploy work in controlled way before
broadening the work to full enterprise of users. This approach enables team
to learn about performance and related constraints of the model in
production environment on small scale  , and make adjustments before full
deployment. The team delivers final reports, briefings, codes. Free or open
source tools – Octave, WEKA, SQL, MADlib.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In today’s world, there are a lot of data. Big companies utilize those data for their business growth. By analyzing this data, the useful decision can be made in various cases as discussed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking Customer Spending Habit, Shopping Behavior:</strong> In big retails
store (like Amazon, Walmart, Big Bazar etc.) management team has to keep
data of customer’s spending habit (in which product customer spent, in
which band they wish to spent, how frequently they spent), shopping
behavior, customer’s most liked product (so that they can keep those
products in the store). Which product is being searched/sold most, based
on that data, production/collection rate of that product get fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> By tracking customer spending habit, shopping
behavior, Big retails store provide a recommendation to the customer.
E-commerce site like Amazon, Walmart, Flipkart does product
recommendation. They track what product a customer is searching, based on
that data they recommend that type of product to that customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Traffic System:</strong> Data about the condition of the traffic of
different road, collected through camera kept beside the road, at entry
and exit point of the city, GPS device placed in the vehicle (Ola, Uber
cab, etc.). All such data are analyzed and jam-free or less jam way, less
time taking ways are recommended. Such a way smart traffic system can be
built in the city by Big data analysis. One more profit is fuel
consumption can be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Air Traffic System:</strong> At various places of flight (like
propeller etc) sensors present. These sensors capture data like the speed
of flight, moisture, temperature, other environmental condition. Based on
such data analysis, an environmental parameter within flight are set up
and varied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto Driving Car:</strong> Big data analysis helps drive a car without human
interpretation. In the various spot of car camera, a sensor placed, that
gather data like the size of the surrounding car, obstacle, distance from
those, etc. These data are being analyzed, then various calculation like
how many angles to rotate, what should be speed, when to stop, etc
carried out. These calculations help to take action automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Personal Assistant Tool:</strong> Big data analysis helps virtual
personal assistant tool (like Siri in Apple Device, Cortana in Windows,
Google Assistant in Android) to provide the answer of the various
question asked by users. This tool tracks the location of the user, their
local time, season, other data related to question asked, etc. Analyzing
all such data, it provides an answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT:</strong> Manufacturing company install IOT sensor into machines to
collect operational data. Analyzing such data, it can be predicted how
long machine will work without any problem when it requires repairing so
that company can take action before the situation when machine facing a
lot of issues or gets totally down. Thus, the cost to replace the whole
machine can be saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Education Sector:</strong> Online educational course conducting organization
utilize big data to search candidate, interested in that course. If
someone searches for YouTube tutorial video on a subject, then online or
offline course provider organization on that subject send ad online to
that person about their course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Sector:</strong> Smart electric meter read consumed power every 15
minutes and sends this read data to the server, where data analyzed and
it can be estimated what is the time in a day when the power load is less
throughout the city. By this system manufacturing unit or housekeeper are
suggested the time when they should drive their heavy machine in the
night time when power load less to enjoy less electricity bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Media and Entertainment Sector:</strong> Media and entertainment service
providing company like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify do analysis on
data collected from their users. Data like what type of video, music
users are watching, listening most, how long users are spending on site,
etc are collected and analyzed to set the next business strategy.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions
about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling,
data mining techniques and machine learning. Companies employ predictive
analytics to find patterns in this data to identify risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>Predictive analytics is often associated with big data and data science.
Companies today are swimming in data that resides across transactional
databases, equipment log files, images, video, sensors or other data sources. To
gain insights from this data, data scientists use deep learning and machine
learning algorithms to find patterns and make predictions about future events.
These include linear and nonlinear regression, neural networks, support vector
machines and decision trees. Learnings obtained through predictive analytics can
then be used further within prescriptive analytics to drive actions based on
predictive insights.</p>
<p>Python and R are two of the languages that are most commonly used for developing
predictive analytics applications.</p>
<h2 id="essential-python-libraries"><a class="header" href="#essential-python-libraries">Essential Python Libraries</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Numpy and Scipy:</strong> Fundamental Scientific Computing NumPy stands for
Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimensional array.
This library also contains basic linear algebra functions, Fourier
transforms, advanced random number capabilities and tools for integration

preparation. Pandas were added relatively recently to Python and have been
instrumental in boosting Python’s usage in data scientist community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> Plotting and Visualization Matplotlib for plotting vast
variety of graphs, starting from histograms to line plots to heat plots..
You can use Pylab feature in ipython notebook (ipython notebook –pylab =
inline) to use these plotting features inline. If you ignore the inline
option, then pylab converts ipython environment to an environment, very
similar to Matlab.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Descriptive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Descriptive analytics looks at what has happened in the past. As the
name suggests, the purpose of descriptive analytics is to simply
describe what has happened; it doesn’t try to explain why this might
have happened or to establish cause-and-effect relationships. The aim is
solely to provide an easily digestible snapshot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Analytics is a good example of descriptive analytics in action;
it provides a simple overview of what’s been going on with your website,
showing you how many people visited in a given time period, for example,
or where your visitors came from. Similarly, tools like HubSpot will
show you how many people opened a particular email or engaged with a
certain campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two main techniques used in descriptive analytics: Data
aggregation and data mining. Data aggregation is the process of
gathering data and presenting it in a summarized format. Let’s imagine
an ecommerce company collects all kinds of data relating to their
customers and people who visit their website. The aggregate data, or
summarized data, would provide an overview of this wider dataset—such as
the average customer age, for example, or the average number of
purchases made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predictive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Predictive analytics seeks to predict what is likely to happen in the
future. Based on past patterns and trends, data analysts can devise
predictive models which estimate the likelihood of a future event or
outcome. This is especially useful as it enables businesses to plan
ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predictive models use the relationship between a set of variables to
make predictions; for example, you might use the correlation between
seasonality and sales figures to predict when sales are likely to drop.
If your predictive model tells you that sales are likely to go down in
summer, you might use this information to come up with a summer-related
promotional campaign, or to decrease expenditure elsewhere to make up
for the seasonal dip. Perhaps you own a restaurant and want to predict
how many takeaway orders you’re likely to get on a typical Saturday
night. Based on what your predictive model tells you, you might decide
to get an extra delivery driver on hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to forecasting, predictive analytics is also used for
classification. A commonly used classification algorithm is logistic
regression, which is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of
independent variables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prescriptive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prescriptive analytics looks at what has happened, why it happened, and
what might happen in order to determine what should be done next. In
other words, prescriptive analytics shows you how you can best take
advantage of the future outcomes that have been predicted. What steps
can you take to avoid a future problem? What can you do to capitalize on
an emerging trend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescriptive analytics is, without doubt, the most complex type of
analysis, involving algorithms, machine learning, statistical methods,
and computational modeling procedures. Essentially, a prescriptive model
considers all the possible decision patterns or pathways a company might
take, and their likely outcomes. This enables you to see how each
combination of conditions and decisions might impact the future, and
allows you to measure the impact a certain decision might have. Based on
all the possible scenarios and potential outcomes, the company can
decide what is the best “route” or action to take.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>Expand <b>Diagnostic</b> analytics(not in syllabus)</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnostic:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While not as exciting as predicting the future, analyzing data from the past can serve an important purpose in guiding your business. Diagnostic data analytics is the process of examining data to understand cause and event or why something happened. Techniques such as drill down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations are often employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagnostic data analytics help answer why something occurred. Like the other categories, it too is broken down into two more specific categories: discover and alerts and query and drill downs. Query and drill downs are used to get more detail from a report. For example, a sales rep that closed significantly fewer deals one month. A drill down could show fewer workdays, due to a two-week vacation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discover and alerts notify of a potential issue before it occurs, for example, an alert about a lower amount of staff hours, which could result in a decrease in closed deals. You could also use diagnostic data analytics to “discover” information such as the most-qualified candidate for a new position at your company.</p>

<h2 id="association-rules"><a class="header" href="#association-rules">Association Rules</a></h2>
<p>Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for
discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is
intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of
interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association
rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items
are connected.</p>
<p>Association rule learning is a great system for predicting the behavior in data
interconnections. This makes it a noteworthy technique for classification, or
discovering patterns in data, when implementing machine learning methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> There are many benefits of using Association rules like
finding the pattern that helps understand the correlations and
co-occurrences between data sets. A very good real-world example that uses
Association rules would be medicine. Medicine uses Association rules to help
diagnose patients. When diagnosing patients there are many variables to
consider as many diseases will share similar symptoms. With the use of the
Association rules, doctors can determine the conditional probability of an
illness by comparing symptom relationships from past cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Downfalls:</strong> However, Association rules also lead to many different
downfalls such as finding the appropriate parameter and threshold settings
for the mining algorithm. But there is also the downfall of having a large
number of discovered rules. The reason is that this does not guarantee
that the rules will be found relevant, but it could also cause the
algorithm to have low performance. Sometimes the implemented algorithms
will contain too many variables and parameters. For someone that doesn’t
have a good concept of data mining, this might cause them to have trouble
understanding it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="apriori-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#apriori-algorithm">Apriori Algorithm</a></h3>
<p>Apriori algorithm is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for finding
frequent itemsets in a dataset for boolean association rule. Name of the
algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset
properties. We apply an iterative approach or level-wise search where k-frequent
itemsets are used to find k+1 itemsets.</p>
<p>To improve the efficiency of level-wise generation of frequent itemsets, an
important property is used called Apriori property which helps by reducing the
search space.</p>
<p><strong>Apriori Property:</strong> All non-empty subset of frequent itemset must be frequent.
The key concept of Apriori algorithm is its anti-monotonicity of support
measure. Apriori assumes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent(Apriori property). If an
itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.</p>

<h3 id="fp-growthfrequent-pattern-growth-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#fp-growthfrequent-pattern-growth-algorithm">FP growth(Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm)</a></h3>
<p>Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm This algorithm is an improvement to the
Apriori method. A frequent pattern is generated without the need for candidate
generation. FP growth algorithm represents the database in the form of a tree
called a frequent pattern tree or FP tree.</p>
<p>This tree structure will maintain the association between the itemsets. The
database is fragmented using one frequent item. This fragmented part is called
“pattern fragment”. The itemsets of these fragmented patterns are analyzed. Thus
with this method, the search for frequent itemsets is reduced comparatively.</p>

<h2 id="regression"><a class="header" href="#regression">Regression</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regression, one of the most common types of machine learning models,
estimates the relationships between variables. Whereas classification models
identify which category an observation belongs to, regression models
estimate a numeric value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of data science, regression specifically refers to the
estimation of a continuous dependent variable or response from a list of
input variables, or features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regression is essential for any machine learning problem that involves
continuous numbers, which includes a vast array of real-life applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial forecasting, such as estimating housing or stock prices</li>
<li>Automobile testing</li>
<li>Weather analysis</li>
<li>Time series forecasting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-regression"><a class="header" href="#linear-regression">Linear Regression</a></h3>
<p>Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning
algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis.
Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables
such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.</p>
<p>Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y)
and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression.
Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how
the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the
independent variable.</p>

<h3 id="logistic-regression"><a class="header" href="#logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</a></h3>
<p>Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete
outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a
binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no,
and so on. Multinomial logistic regression can model scenarios where there are
more than two possible discrete outcomes. Logistic regression is a useful
analysis method for classification problems, where you are trying to determine
if a new sample fits best into a category. As aspects of cyber security are
classification problems, such as attack detection, logistic regression is a
useful analytic technique.</p>

<h2 id="classification"><a class="header" href="#classification">Classification</a></h2>
<p>Data Classification is the process of organizing data into categories for its
most effective and efficient use.</p>
<p>In a time where nearly everything is digitized, from personal records to highly
sensitive corporate data, it's about time we take a closer look into
classification. Data classification in data science refers to the process that
tags and categorizes any kind of data so that it can be better understood and
analyzed. The latter is what we'll be focusing on.</p>
<p>But also, a well-planned data classification system makes essential data easy to
find and retrieve. This can be of particular importance for risk management,
legal discovery, and compliance.</p>

<h3 id="naive-bayes"><a class="header" href="#naive-bayes">Naive Bayes</a></h3>
<p>In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple &quot;probabilistic
classifiers&quot; based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence
assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the
simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation,
they can achieve high accuracy levels.</p>
<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters
linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem.
Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression,
which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as
used for many other types of classifiers.</p>

<h3 id="decision-trees"><a class="header" href="#decision-trees">Decision Trees</a></h3>
<p>A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or
make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered. The
model is a form of supervised learning, meaning that the model is trained and
tested on a set of data that contains the desired categorization.</p>
<p>The decision tree may not always provide a clear-cut answer or decision.
Instead, it may present options so the data scientist can make an informed
decision on their own. Decision trees imitate human thinking, so it’s generally
easy for data scientists to understand and interpret the results.</p>

<h2 id="clustering-algorithms"><a class="header" href="#clustering-algorithms">Clustering Algorithms</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task. You might also hear
this referred to as cluster analysis because of the way this method works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a clustering algorithm means you're going to give the algorithm a lot
of input data with no labels and let it find any groupings in the data it
can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those groupings are called clusters. A cluster is a group of data points
that are similar to each other based on their relation to surrounding data
points. Clustering is used for things like feature engineering or pattern
discovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of clustering algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution-based:</strong> With a distribution-based clustering approach,
all of the data points are considered parts of a cluster based on the
probability that they belong to a given cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centroid-based:</strong> Centroid-based clustering is the one you probably
hear about the most. It's a little sensitive to the initial parameters
you give it, but it's fast and efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hierarchical-based:</strong> Hierarchical-based clustering is typically used
on hierarchical data, like you would get from a company database or
taxonomies. It builds a tree of clusters so everything is organized from
the top-down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="k-means"><a class="header" href="#k-means">K-Means</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>K-means clustering is the most commonly used clustering algorithm. It's a
centroid-based algorithm and the simplest unsupervised learning algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This algorithm tries to minimize the variance of data points within a
cluster. It's also how most people are introduced to unsupervised machine
learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>K-means is best used on smaller data sets because it iterates over all of
the data points. That means it'll take more time to classify data points if
there are a large amount of them in the data set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since this is how k-means clusters data points, it doesn't scale well.</p>
</li>

<p>Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points
collected over an interval of time. In time series analysis, analysts record
data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just
recording the data points intermittently or randomly. However, this type of
analysis is not merely the act of collecting data over time.</p>
<p>What sets time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show
how variables change over time. In other words, time is a crucial variable
because it shows how the data adjusts over the course of the data points as well
as the final results. It provides an additional source of information and a set
order of dependencies between the data.</p>

processing (NLP) pipelines, including voice recognition software, search engine
lookup, and machine learning model training. It is an essential step because
text data can vary. From its format (website, text message, voice recognition)
to the people who create the text (language, dialect), there are plenty of
things that can introduce noise into your data.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of cleaning and preparing text data is to reduce the text to
only the words that you need for your NLP goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Scalability and dynamics are two major challenges in visual analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big Data visualization can be an extremely powerful business capability, but
before an organization can take advantage of it some key issues need to be
addressed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability of visualization specialists:</strong> Many Big Data
visualization tools are designed to be easy enough for anyone in an
organization to use, often suggesting appropriate Big Data visualization
examples  for the data sets under analysis. But to get the most out of
some tools  it may be necessary to employ a specialist in big data
visualization techniques who can select the best data sets and
visualization styles to ensure the data is exploited to the maximum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visualization hardware resources:</strong> Under the hood, Big Data
visualization is essentially a computing task, and the ability to carry
out this task quickly – to enable organizations to make decisions in a
timely manner using real-time data – may require powerful computer
hardware, fast storage systems, or even a move to cloud. That means Big
Data visualization initiatives are as much an IT project as a management
project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data quality:</strong> The insights that can be drawn from Big Data
visualization are only as accurate as the data that is being visualized:
if it is inaccurate or out of date then the value of any insights is
questionable. That means people and processes need to be put in place
to manage corporate data, metadata, data sources, and any
transformations or data cleaning that are performed before storage.</p>

<h2 id="hadoop-ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#hadoop-ecosystem">Hadoop ecosystem</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hadoop Ecosystem is a platform or a suite which provides various services to
solve the big data problems. It includes Apache projects and various
commercial tools and solutions. There are four major elements of Hadoop i.e.
HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, and Hadoop Common. Most of the tools or solutions are
used to supplement or support these major elements. All these tools work
collectively to provide services such as absorption, analysis, storage and
maintenance of data etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="pictures/hadoop_eco.png" alt="Hadoop Ecosystem" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following are the components that collectively form a Hadoop ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HDFS:</strong> Hadoop Distributed File System</li>
<li><strong>YARN:</strong> Yet Another Resource Negotiator</li>
<li><strong>MapReduce:</strong> Programming based Data Processing</li>
<li><strong>Spark:</strong> In-Memory data processing</li>
<li><strong>PIG, HIVE:</strong> Query based processing of data services</li>
<li><strong>HBase:</strong> NoSQL Database</li>
<li><strong>Mahout, Spark MLLib:</strong> Machine Learning algorithm libraries</li>
<li><strong>Solar, Lucene:</strong> Searching and Indexing</li>
<li><strong>Zookeeper:</strong> Managing cluster</li>

<h3 id="map-reduce"><a class="header" href="#map-reduce">Map Reduce</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By making the use of distributed and parallel algorithms, MapReduce makes it
possible to carry over the processing’s logic and helps to write
applications which transform big data sets into a manageable one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MapReduce makes the use of two functions i.e. Map() and Reduce() whose task
is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map() performs sorting and filtering of data and thereby organizing them
in the form of group. Map generates a key-value pair based result which is
later on processed by the Reduce() method.</li>
<li>Reduce(), as the name suggests does the summarization by aggregating the
mapped data. In simple, Reduce() takes the output generated by Map() as
input and combines those tuples into smaller set of tuples.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Add more in map reduce and pig -->
<h3 id="pig"><a class="header" href="#pig">Pig</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pig was basically developed by Yahoo which works on a pig Latin language,
which is Query based language similar to SQL.</li>
<li>It is a platform for structuring the data flow, processing and analyzing
huge data sets.</li>
<li>Pig does the work of executing commands and in the background, all the
activities of MapReduce are taken care of. After the processing, pig stores
the result in HDFS.</li>
<li>Pig Latin language is specially designed for this framework which runs on
Pig Runtime. Just the way Java runs on the JVM.</li>
<li>Pig helps to achieve ease of programming and optimization and hence is a
major segment of the Hadoop Ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hive"><a class="header" href="#hive">Hive</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>With the help of SQL methodology and interface, HIVE performs reading and
writing of large data sets. However, its query language is called as HQL
(Hive Query Language).</li>
<li>It is highly scalable as it allows real-time processing and batch processing
both. Also, all the SQL datatypes are supported by Hive thus, making the
query processing easier.</li>
<li>Similar to the Query Processing frameworks, HIVE too comes with two
components: JDBC Drivers and HIVE Command Line.</li>
<li>JDBC, along with ODBC drivers work on establishing the data storage
permissions and connection whereas HIVE Command line helps in the processing
of queries.</li>

<p>Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python. The pyplot, a sublibrary
of matplotlib, is a collection of functions that helps in creating a variety of
charts.  Line charts are used to represent the relation between two data X and Y
on a different axis. Here we will see some of the examples of a line chart in
Python :</p>

<p>A histogram is basically used to represent data provided in a form of some
groups.It is accurate method for the graphical representation of numerical data
distribution.It is a type of bar plot where X-axis represents the bin ranges
while Y-axis gives information about frequency.</p>

<h3 id="density-plot"><a class="header" href="#density-plot">Density plot</a></h3>
<p>Density Plot is a type of data visualization tool. It is a variation of the
histogram that uses ‘kernel smoothing’ while plotting the values. It is a
continuous and smooth version of a histogram inferred from a data.</p>
<p>Density plots uses Kernel Density Estimation (so they are also known as Kernel
density estimation plots or KDE) which is a probability density function. The
region of plot with a higher peak is the region with maximum data points
residing between those values.</p>
<p>Density plots can be made using pandas, seaborn, etc. In this article, we will
generate density plots using Pandas. We will be using two datasets of the
Seaborn Library namely – ‘car_crashes’ and ‘tips’.</p>

<h3 id="box-plot"><a class="header" href="#box-plot">Box-plot</a></h3>
<p>A Box Plot is also known as Whisker plot is created to display the summary of
the set of data values having properties like minimum, first quartile, median,
third quartile and maximum. In the box plot, a box is created from the first
quartile to the third quartile, a vertical line is also there which goes through
the box at the median. Here x-axis denotes the data to be plotted while the
y-axis shows the frequency distribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Analytics Lifecycle defines the roadmap of how data is generated,
collected, processed, used, and analyzed to achieve business goals. It
offers a systematic way to manage data for converting it into
information that can be used to fulfill organizational and project
goals. The process provides the direction and methods to extract
information from the data and proceed in the right direction to
accomplish business goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data professionals use the lifecycle’s circular form to proceed with
data analytics in either forward or backward direction. Based on the
newly received insights, they can decide whether to proceed with their
existing research or scrap it and redo the complete analysis. The Data
Analytics lifecycle guides them throughout this process.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider an example of a retail store chain that wants to optimize its
products’ prices for boosting its revenue. The store chain has thousands
of products over hundreds of outlets, making it a highly complex
scenario. Once you identify the store chain’s objective, you find the
data you need, prepare it, and go through the Data Analytics lifecycle
process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You observe different types of customers, such as ordinary customers and
customers like contractors who buy in bulk. According to you, treating
various types of customers differently can give you the solution.
However, you don’t have enough information about it and need to discuss
this with the client team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, you need to get the definition, find data, and conduct the
hypothesis testing to check whether various customer types impact the
model results and get the right output. Once you are convinced with the
model results, you can deploy the model, integrate it into the business,
and you are all set to deploy the prices you think are the most optimal
across the outlets of the store.</p>

<h2 id="servlet"><a class="header" href="#servlet">Servlet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server. Servlets
receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP, the
HyperText Transfer Protocol. To implement this interface, you can write a
generic servlet that extends javax. servlet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servlets are grouped under the Advanced Java tree that are used to create
dynamic web applications. Servlets are robust in nature, well scalable and
are primarily used in developing server-side applications. If we go a little
back in time, we would be able to witness that before the introduction of
servlets, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) were used. Amid several indigenous
tasks that a servlet is capable of doing, dynamically performing client
requests and responses are most common. Other tasks that a servlet can do
effectively are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can easily manage/control the application flow.</li>
<li>Suitable to implement business logic.</li>
<li>Can effectively balance the load at the server-side.</li>
<li>Easily generate dynamic web content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talking about the types of servlets, there are primarily two types, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generic Servlets</li>
<li>HTTP Servlets</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three potential ways in which we can employ to create a servlet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementing Servlet Interface</li>
<li>Extending Generic Servlet</li>
<li>Extending HTTP Servlet</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prime functionality of a servlet is that they are independent of server
configuration and they are pretty much compatible with any of the web
servers</li>
<li>Servlets are also protocol-independent supporting FTP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.
protocols to the fullest.</li>
<li>Until destroyed manually, servlets can be retained in the memory helping
process several requests over time. Also, once a database connection is
established, it can facilitate process several requests for a database in
the very same database session.</li>
<li>Servlets inherit Java’s property of portability and hence are compatible
with nearly any web server.</li>
<li>Servlets are first converted into byte codes and then executed, which
helps in increasing the processing time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designing a servlet can be pretty laborious.</li>
<li>Exceptions need to be handled while designing a servlet since they are not
thread-safe.</li>
<li>Developers may need additional skills to program a servlet.</li>

<h3 id="servlet-architecture-overview"><a class="header" href="#servlet-architecture-overview">Servlet architecture overview</a></h3>
<p><img src="pictures/servlet_arch.png" alt="Components of servlet architecture" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Client:</strong> The client shown in the architecture above is primarily working
as a medium who is sending out HTTP requests over to the web server and again
processing the response it gets back from the server. As we can see in the
diagram, our client here is the web browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Server:</strong> Primary job of a web server is to process the requests and
responses that a user sends over time and maintain how a web user would be able
to access the files that has been hosted over the server. The server we are
talking about here is a software which manages access to a centralized resource
or service in a network.. There are precisely two types of webservers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Static web server</li>
<li>Dynamic web server</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Container:</strong> Web container is another typical component in servlet
architecture which is responsible for communicating with the servlets. Two prime
tasks of a web container are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing the servlet lifecycle</li>
<li>URL mapping</li>
</ul>
<p>Web container sits at the server-side managing and handling all the requests
that are coming in either from the servlets or from some JSP pages or
potentially any other file system.</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading a Servlet.</li>
<li>Initializing the Servlet.</li>
<li>Request handling.</li>
<li>Destroying the Servlet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s look at each of these stages in details:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Loading a Servlet:</strong> The first stage of the Servlet lifecycle involves
loading and initializing the Servlet by the Servlet container. The Web
container or Servlet Container can load the Servlet at either of the
following two stages :</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializing the context, on configuring the Servlet with a zero or
positive integer value.</li>
<li>If the Servlet is not preceding stage, it may delay the loading
process until the Web container determines that this Servlet is
needed to service a request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initializing a Servlet:</strong> After the Servlet is instantiated
successfully, the Servlet container initializes the instantiated Servlet
object. The container initializes the Servlet object by invoking the
Servlet.init(ServletConfig) method which accepts ServletConfig object
reference as parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling request:</strong> After initialization, the Servlet instance is
ready to serve the client requests. The Servlet container performs the
following operations when the Servlet instance is located to service a
request :</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates the ServletRequest and ServletResponse objects. In this
case, if this is a HTTP request, then the Web container creates
HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects which are
subtypes of the ServletRequest and ServletResponse objects
respectively.</li>
<li>After creating the request and response objects it invokes the
Servlet.service(ServletRequest, ServletResponse) method by passing
the request and response objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Destroying a Servlet:</strong> When a Servlet container decides to destroy
the Servlet, it performs the following operations,</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows all the threads currently running in the service method of
the Servlet instance to complete their jobs and get released.</li>
<li>After currently running threads have completed their jobs, the
Servlet container calls the destroy() method on the Servlet
instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After the destroy() method is executed, the Servlet container releases all
the references of this Servlet instance so that it becomes eligible for
garbage collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Servlet Life Cycle Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are three life cycle methods of a Servlet :
<ul>
<li>init()</li>
<li>service()</li>
<li>destroy()</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parameter-data"><a class="header" href="#parameter-data">Parameter data</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parameters may come into our application from the client request, or may be
configured through deployment descriptor (web.xml) elements or their
corresponding annotations. When you submit a form, form values are sent as
request parameters to a web application. In case of a GET request, these
parameters are exposed in the URL as name value pairs and in case of POST,
parameters are sent within the body of the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servlet init parameters and context init parameters are set through the
deployment descriptor (web.xml) or their corresponding annotations. All
parameters are read-only from the application code. We have methods in the
Servlet API to retrieve various parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attributes are objects that are attached to various scopes and can be
modified, retrieved or removed. Attributes can be read, created, updated and
deleted by the web container as well as our application code. We have methods
in the Servlet API to add, modif, retrieve and remove attributes. When an
object is added to an attribute in any scope, it is called binding as the
object is bound into a scoped attribute with a given name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important differences between attributes and parameters in JSP/servlets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parameters are read only, attributes are read/write objects.</li>
<li>Parameters are String objects, attributes can be objects of any type.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sessions"><a class="header" href="#sessions">Sessions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Session simply means a particular interval of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Session Tracking is a way to maintain state (data) of an user. It is also
known as session management in servlet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Http protocol is a stateless so we need to maintain state using session
tracking techniques. Each time user requests to the server, server treats
the request as the new request. So we need to maintain the state of an user
to recognize to particular user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP is stateless that means each request is considered as the new request.
It is shown in the figure given below:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are four techniques used in Session tracking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Hidden Form Field</li>
<li>URL Rewriting</li>
<li>HttpSession</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cookies"><a class="header" href="#cookies">Cookies</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of information that is persisted between the
multiple client requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cookie has a name, a single value, and optional attributes such as a
comment, path and domain qualifiers, a maximum age, and a version number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How Cookie works:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, each request is considered as a new request. In cookies
technique, we add cookie with response from the servlet. So cookie is
stored in the cache of the browser. After that if request is sent by the
user, cookie is added with request by default. Thus, we recognize the
user as the old user.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="pictures/cookie.png" alt="Cookie" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 2 types of cookies in servlets:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-persistent cookie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is valid for single session only. It is removed each time when
user closes the browser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistent cookie:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is valid for multiple session . It is not removed each time when
user closes the browser. It is removed only if user logout or
signout.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantage of Cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplest technique of maintaining the state.</li>
<li>Cookies are maintained at client side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disadvantage of Cookies</p>
<ul>
<li>It will not work if cookie is disabled from the browser.</li>
<li>Only textual information can be set in Cookie object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="url-rewriting"><a class="header" href="#url-rewriting">URL rewriting</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In URL rewriting, we append a token or identifier to the URL of the next
Servlet or the next resource. We can send parameter name/value pairs using
the following format:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>url?name1=value1&amp;name2=value2&amp;??</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A name and a value is separated using an equal = sign, a parameter
name/value pair is separated from another parameter using the ampersand(&amp;).
When the user clicks the hyperlink, the parameter name/value pairs will be
passed to the server. From a Servlet, we can use getParameter() method to
obtain a parameter value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantage of URL Rewriting</p>
<ul>
<li>It will always work whether cookie is disabled or not (browser
independent).</li>
<li>Extra form submission is not required on each pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disadvantage of URL Rewriting</p>
<ul>
<li>It will work only with links.</li>
<li>It can send Only textual information.</li>

<h3 id="servlets-concurrency"><a class="header" href="#servlets-concurrency">Servlets concurrency</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Java servlet container or web server is multithreaded and multiple requests
to the same servlet may be executed at the same time. Therefore, we need to
take concurrency into consideration while writing servlet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we discussed earlier that one and only one instance of Servlet gets created
and for every new request , Servlet Container spawn a new thread to execute
doGet() or doPost() methof of a servlet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default servlets are not thread safe and it is a responsibility of  a
servlet developer to take care of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this chapter we will discuss about concurrency in servlets and this is very
important concept so your attention is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are certain points which we should consider while writing servlets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service() , doGet(), doPost() or to be more generic doXXX()  methods
should not update or modify instance variables as instance variables are
shared by all threads of same instance.</li>
<li>If you have a requirement which requires modification of instance variable
then do it in a synchronized block.</li>
<li>Above two rules are applicable for static variables also because they are
also shared.</li>
<li>Local variables are always thread safe.</li>
<li>The request and response objects are thread safe to use because new
instance of these are created for every request into your servlet, and
thus for every thread executing in your servlet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="xml"><a class="header" href="#xml">XML</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but
without predefined tags to use. Instead, you define your own tags designed
specifically for your needs. This is a powerful way to store data in a format
that can be stored, searched, and shared.</p>

<h3 id="xml-documents-and-vocabularies"><a class="header" href="#xml-documents-and-vocabularies">XML documents and vocabularies</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XML documents are strictly text files. In the context of data transport, the
phrase &quot;XML document&quot; refers to a file or data stream containing any form of
structured data. Examples include e-commerce transactions, server APIs,
mathematical equations, customer information, and inventory status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML documents contain only markup and content. All of the rules and semantics
of the document are defined by the applications that process them. Like HTML
documents, XML documents can be displayed in a Web browser. In this case, the
semantics are usually derived from style sheets or Resource Description
Framework (RDF) files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML documents are said to be either &quot;well-formed&quot; or &quot;valid.&quot; Well-formed
documents follow all of the XML rules for a document–for example, for every
start tag, there is a corresponding end tag. Valid XML documents are
well-formed, but they also contain a document type definition (DTD), and they
obey the constraints of that definition. ### XML declaration</p>

<h3 id="xml-namespaces"><a class="header" href="#xml-namespaces">XML Namespaces</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XML namespaces are used for providing uniquely named elements and attributes
in an XML document. They are defined in a W3C recommendation.[1][2] An XML
instance may contain element or attribute names from more than one XML
vocabulary. If each vocabulary is given a namespace, the ambiguity between
identically named elements or attributes can be resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A simple example would be to consider an XML instance that contained
references to a customer and an ordered product. Both the customer element and
the product element could have a child element named id. References to the id
element would therefore be ambiguous; placing them in different namespaces
would remove the ambiguity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML Namespaces provide a method to avoid element name conflicts.</p>

<h3 id="dom-based-xml-processing"><a class="header" href="#dom-based-xml-processing">DOM based XML processing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The XML Document Object Model (DOM) treats XML data as a standard set of
objects and is used to process XML data in memory. The System.Xml namespace
provides a programmatic representation of XML documents, fragments, nodes, or
node-sets. It is based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) DOM Level 1 Core
and the DOM Level 2 Core recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The XmlDocument class represents an XML document. It includes members for
retrieving and creating all other XML objects. Using the XmlDocument, and its
related classes, you can construct XML documents, load and access data, modify
data, and save changes.</p>

<h3 id="transforming-xml-documents"><a class="header" href="#transforming-xml-documents">Transforming XML documents</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now that we've covered parsing, generating, and searching an XML document, we
get into another very important part of XML processing—XML transformation. You
can transform, or in other words convert, an XML document to another format by
applying various transformation techniques. You can transform the XML document
to either another XML document, which might be a subset of the original
document by filtering certain info, or you can transform to a whole different
data format, like HTML, eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), Wireless
Markup Language (WML), CSV, and so forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would you want to convert our neatly formatted XML document to another
format? We can read and understand the data as-is. Well the answer is,
although as a technically savvy individual you took the time to learn XML and
are now able to read it, most people would prefer their data represented in a
user-friendly format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most popular methods of transforming XML to another format is to
use the eXtensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) standard. An
XSLT processor provides the interface needed to transform XML data. One of the
processor's components is the XML parser itself, which is needed for the XSLT
processor to understand and interact with XML. This makes sense if you think
about it—the XSLT processor needs to parse the document to extract the
information contained in the XML before it can format the contents. The
processor requires an XSLT stylesheet to perform the transformation. An XSLT
stylesheet is itself an XML document that contains embedded rules used to
perform the transformation. An XSLT processor uses XPath and the rules
contained in the XSLT stylesheet to transform the document. It searches
through the XML data using XPath and tries to find the desired elements.</p>

<h2 id="dtd"><a class="header" href="#dtd">DTD</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A DTD is a Document Type Definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree on a standard DTD for interchanging data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application can use a DTD to verify that XML data is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An XML document with correct syntax is called &quot;Well Formed&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An XML document validated against a DTD is both &quot;Well Formed&quot; and &quot;Valid&quot;.</p>

<h3 id="schema"><a class="header" href="#schema">Schema</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The purpose of an XML Schema is to define the legal building blocks of an XML
document:</p>
<ul>
<li>the elements and attributes that can appear in a document</li>
<li>the number of (and order of) child elements</li>
<li>data types for elements and attributes</li>
<li>default and fixed values for elements and attributes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the XML world, hundreds of standardized XML formats are in daily use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of these XML standards are defined by XML Schemas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML Schema is an XML-based (and more powerful) alternative to DTD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the greatest strength of XML Schemas is the support for data types.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easier to describe allowable document content</li>
<li>It is easier to validate the correctness of data</li>
<li>It is easier to define data facets (restrictions on data)</li>
<li>It is easier to define data patterns (data formats)</li>
<li>It is easier to convert data between different data types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML Schemas use XML Syntax</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to learn a new language</li>
<li>You can use your XML editor to edit your Schema files</li>
<li>You can use your XML parser to parse your Schema files</li>
<li>You can manipulate your Schema with the XML DOM</li>
<li>You can transform your Schema with XSLT</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML Schemas are extensible, because they are written in XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With an extensible Schema definition you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reuse your Schema in other Schemas</li>
<li>Create your own data types derived from the standard types</li>
<li>Reference multiple schemas in the same document</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences between an XML Schema Definition (XSD) and Document Type
Definition (DTD) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XML schemas are written in XML while DTD are derived from SGML syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML schemas define datatypes for elements and attributes while DTD doesn't
support datatypes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML schemas allow support for namespaces while DTD does not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML schemas define number and order of child elements, while DTD does not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML schemas can be manipulated on your own with XML DOM but it is not
possible in case of DTD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using XML schema user need not to learn a new language but working with
DTD is difficult for a user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML schema provides secure data communication i.e sender can describe the
data in a way that receiver will understand, but in case of DTD data can
be misunderstood by the receiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XML schemas are extensible while DTD is not extensible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>DTD lets you define new ENTITY values for use in your XML file.</li>
<li>DTD lets you extend it local to an individual XML file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elements"><a class="header" href="#elements">Elements</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XML elements can be defined as building blocks of an XML document. Elements can behave as a container to hold text, elements, attributes, media objects or mix of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a DTD, elements are declared with an ELEMENT declaration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a DTD, XML elements are declared with the following syntax:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A DTD element is declared with an ELEMENT declaration. When an XML file is validated by DTD, parser initially checks for the root element and then the child elements are validated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!ELEMENT elementname (content)&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><em>elementname</em> is the element name (also called the generic identifier) that you are defining.</li>
<li><em>ELEMENT</em> declaration is used to indicate the parser that you are about to define an element.</li>
<li><em>content</em> defines what content (if any) can go within the element.</li>

<h3 id="attributes"><a class="header" href="#attributes">Attributes</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a DTD, attributes are declared with an ATTLIST declaration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attribute declaration is very much similar to element declarations in many
ways except one; instead of declaring allowable content for elements, you
declare a list of allowable attributes for each element. These lists are
called ATTLIST declaration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax: <code>xml &lt;!ATTLIST element-name attribute-name attribute-type attribute-value&gt; </code></p>
<ul>
<li>In the above syntax −
<ul>
<li>The DTD attributes start with &lt;!ATTLIST keyword if the element
contains the attribute.</li>
<li><strong>element-name</strong> specifies the name of the element to which the
attribute applies.</li>
<li><strong>attribute-name</strong> specifies the name of the attribute which is
included with the element-name.</li>
<li><strong>attribute-type</strong> defines the type of attributes. We will discuss
more on this in the following sections.</li>

<h2 id="ajax"><a class="header" href="#ajax">AJAX</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ajax is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies
on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web
applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the
background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing
page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer,
Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content
dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern
implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ajax is not a technology, but rather a programming concept. HTML and CSS can
be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage can be
modified by JavaScript to dynamically display—and allow the user to interact
with the new information. The built-in XMLHttpRequest object is used to
execute Ajax on webpages, allowing websites to load content onto the screen
without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, nor is it a new
language. Instead, it is existing technologies used in a new way.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>It is used for creating web application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is used to create dynamic web content.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It is a Web based technology helps us to create dynamic and platform
independent web pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSP is first converted into servlet by JSP container before processing the
client’s request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSP pages are more advantageous than Servlet:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are easy to maintain.</li>
<li>No recompilation or redeployment is required.</li>
<li>JSP has access to entire API of JAVA .</li>
<li>JSP are extended version of Servlet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications of JSP</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>JSP vs. Active Server Pages (ASP):</strong> The advantages of JSP are
twofold. First, the dynamic part is written in Java, not Visual Basic or
other MS specific language, so it is more powerful and easier to use.
Second, it is portable to other operating systems and non-Microsoft Web
servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JSP vs. Pure Servlets:</strong> It is more convenient to write (and to
modify!) regular HTML than to have plenty of println statements that
generate the HTML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JSP vs. Server-Side Includes (SSI):</strong> SSI is really only intended for
simple inclusions, not for &quot;real&quot; programs that use form data, make
database connections, and the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JSP vs. JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript can generate HTML dynamically on the
client but can hardly interact with the web server to perform complex
tasks like database access and image processing etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JSP vs. Static HTML:</strong> Regular HTML, of course, cannot contain dynamic
information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features of JSP</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding in JSP is easy :- As it is just adding JAVA code to HTML/XML.</li>
<li>Reduction in the length of Code :- In JSP we use action tags, custom
tags etc.</li>
<li>Connection to Database is easier :-It is easier to connect website to
database and allows to read or write data easily to the database.</li>
<li>Make Interactive websites :- In this we can create dynamic web pages
which helps user to interact in real time environment.</li>
<li>Portable, Powerful, flexible and easy to maintain :- as these are
browser and server independent.</li>
<li>No Redeployment and No Re-Compilation :- It is dynamic, secure and
platform independent so no need to re-compilation.</li>
<li>Extension to Servlet :- as it has all features of servlets, implicit
objects and custom tags</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A Java Server Page, or JSP, program is a crucial part of a Java web
application because the JSP will send a response back to the server in the
form of a web page. For example, a JSP might display the line items of an
order to the browser user. In this topic, you will create a very simple JSP
and learn how to run the program at the Tomcat server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a JSP application in 7 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In your text editor, you will develop a simple JSP that creates a web page to
display the current date. Type in the following statements in a new file:</p>
<!-- CODE -->
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot; contentType=&quot;text/html&quot;%&gt;
&lt;%@ page import=&quot;java.text.*,java.util.*&quot; %&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Date JSP&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;% SimpleDateFormat sdf=new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy&quot;); %&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Tomcat! Today is &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program contains <code>&lt;%@</code> tags that provide metadata about the JSP and
import directives. The JSP also contains HTML tags that will be rendered by
the browser in the usual way. Note the <code>&lt;%</code> tags that encapsulate Java code.
The snippets of Java code are referred to as &quot;scriplets.&quot; When the JSP is
requested by the browser, the program will be converted into a servlet by a
program in the Tomcat container (<code>Jasper</code>) and the HTML output will be sent
to the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save your file as <code>DateJSP.jsp</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy your file to <code>CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT</code>, e.g.,
<code>c:/Tomcat8/webapps/ROOT</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the Tomcat server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start your browser if it is not already running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the address area of the browser, type <code>http://localhost:8080/DateJSP.jsp</code>
and submit that address to the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The output of your JSP page will be displayed:</p>

<li>All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods.</li>
</ol>

<p>MVC stands for Model View and Controller. It is a design pattern that separates the business logic, presentation logic and data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controller acts as an interface between View and Model. Controller intercepts all the incoming requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model represents the state of the application i.e. data. It can also have business logic.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices
over a network. It is a software function provided at a network address over
the Web with the service always-on as in the concept of utility computing.
Many organizations use multiple software systems for management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web services are self-contained, modular, distributed, dynamic applications
that can be described, published, located, or invoked over the network to
create products, processes, and supply chains. These applications can be
local, distributed, or web-based. Web services are built on top of open
standards such as TCP/IP, HTTP, Java, HTML, and XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web services are XML-based information exchange systems that use the Internet
for direct application-to-application interaction. These systems can include
programs, objects, messages, or documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A web service is a collection of open protocols and standards used for
exchanging data between applications or systems. Software applications written
in various programming languages and running on various platforms can use web
services to exchange data over computer networks like the Internet in a manner
similar to inter-process communication on a single computer. This
interoperability (e.g., between Java and Python, or Windows and Linux
applications) is due to the use of open standards.</p>

<p>Components(Types) of Web Services</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):</strong> SOAP stands for “Simple Object
Access Protocol.” It is a transport-independent messaging protocol. SOAP
is built on sending XML data in the form of SOAP Messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration):</strong> UDDI is a
standard for specifying, publishing and discovering a service provider’s
online services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WSDL (Web Services Description Language):</strong> If a web service can’t be
found, it can’t be used. The client invoking the web service should be
aware of the location of the web service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>REST(Representational State Transfer):</strong>
Is an architectural style, meaning each unique URL represents an individual
object of some sort. A REST web service uses HTTP and supports/repurposes
several HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT or DELETE. It also offers simple
CRUD-oriented services. Fun fact: The original RESTful architecture was
designed by one of the leading authors of HTTP, Roy Fielding.</p>

<li>
<p>SOAP is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP. It has
some specification which could be used across all applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOAP is known as the Simple Object Access Protocol, but in later times was
just shortened to SOAP v1.2. SOAP is a protocol or in other words is a
definition of how web services talk to each other or talk to client
applications that invoke them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOAP was developed as an intermediate language so that applications built on
various programming languages could talk easily to each other and avoid the
extreme development effort.</p>

<h2 id="struts"><a class="header" href="#struts">Struts</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Apache Struts 2 is an open-source web application framework for developing
Java EE web applications. It uses and extends the Java Servlet API to
encourage developers to adopt a model–view–controller (MVC) architecture. The
WebWork framework spun off from Apache Struts 1 aiming to offer enhancements
and refinements while retaining the same general architecture of the original
Struts framework. In December 2005, it was announced that WebWork 2.2 was
adopted as Apache Struts 2, which reached its first full release in February
2007.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/struts-2-tutorial">Overview</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="architecture"><a class="header" href="#architecture">Architecture</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Struts 2 is slightly different from a traditional MVC framework, where the
action takes the role of the model rather than the controller, although there
is some overlap.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/struts_2_architecture.gif" alt="Struts 2 Architecture" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The above diagram depicts the Model, View and Controller to the Struts2 high
level architecture. The controller is implemented with a Struts2 dispatch
servlet filter as well as interceptors, this model is implemented with
actions, and the view is a combination of result types and results. The value
stack and OGNL provides common thread, linking and enabling integration
between the other components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request Life Cycle Based on the above diagram, you can understand the work
flow through user's request life cycle in Struts 2 as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User sends a request to the server for requesting for some resource (i.e.
pages).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Filter Dispatcher looks at the request and then determines the
appropriate Action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configured interceptor functionalities applies such as validation, file
upload etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selected action is performed based on the requested operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, configured interceptors are applied to do any post-processing if
required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the result is prepared by the view and returns the result to the
user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration"><a class="header" href="#configuration">Configuration</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configuration files like web.xml, struts.xml, strutsconfig.xml and
struts.properties are used to configure a Struts 2 application.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>web.xml</strong> File: The web.xml configuration file is a J2EE
configuration file that determines how elements of the HTTP request are
processed by the servlet container. It is not strictly a Struts2
configuration file, but it is a file that needs to be configured for
Struts2 to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Struts.xml</strong> File: The struts.xml file contains the configuration
information that you will be modifying as actions are developed. This
file can be used to override default settings for an application, for
example struts.devMode = false and other settings which are defined in
property file. This file can be created under the folder
WEB-INF/classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Struts-config.xml</strong> File: The struts-config.xml configuration file
is a link between the View and Model components in the Web Client but
you would not have to touch these settings for 99.99% of your projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Struts.properties</strong> File: This configuration file provides a
mechanism to change the default behavior of the framework. Actually, all
the properties contained within the struts.properties configuration file
can also be configured in the web.xml using the init-param, as well
using the constant tag in the struts.xml configuration file. But, if you
like to keep the things separate and more struts specific, then you can
create this file under the folder WEB-INF/classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

look</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="actions"><a class="header" href="#actions">Actions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actions are the core of the Struts2 framework, as they are for any MVC (Model
View Controller) framework. Each URL is mapped to a specific action, which
provides the processing logic which is necessary to service the request from
the user.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interceptors"><a class="header" href="#interceptors">Interceptors</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interceptors are conceptually the same as servlet filters or the JDKs Proxy
class. Interceptors allow for crosscutting functionality to be implemented
separately from the action as well as the framework. You can achieve the
following using interceptors −</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing preprocessing logic before the action is called.</li>
<li>Providing postprocessing logic after the action is called.</li>
<li>Catching exceptions so that alternate processing can be performed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="php"><a class="header" href="#php">PHP</a></h2>
<p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It
was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The
PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-php"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-php">Introduction to PHP</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more
people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first
version of PHP way back in 1994.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PHP is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great
Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain.
I will list down some of the key advantages of learning PHP:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP is a recursive acronym for &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor&quot;.</li>
<li>PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is
used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build
entire e-commerce sites.</li>
<li>It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL,
PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
<li>PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an
Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes
even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.</li>
<li>PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and
LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures
(COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first
time.</li>
<li>PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.</li>
<li>PHP Syntax is C-Like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uses-of-php"><a class="header" href="#uses-of-php">Uses of PHP</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create,
open, read, write, and close them.</li>
<li>PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file,
through email you can send data, return data to the user.</li>
<li>You add, delete, modify elements within your database through PHP.</li>
<li>Access cookies variables and set cookies.</li>
<li>Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.</li>
<li>It can encrypt data.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing the PHP code inside <?php ….?> is called Escaping to PH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canonical PHP Tags:</strong> The script starts with <?php and ends with ?>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
# Here echo command is used to print
echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>Hello, world!</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SGML</strong> or Short HTML Tags: These are the shortest option to initialize a
PHP code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">  &lt;?
  # Here echo command will only work if
  # setting is done as said before
  echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
  ?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Output: <code>Hello, world!</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ASP Style Tags:</strong> To use this we need to set the configuration of the
php.ini file. These are used by Active Server Pages to describe code blocks.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;%
# Can only be written if setting is turned on
# to allow %
echo &quot;hello world&quot;;

<li>
<p>PHP is case-sensitive</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>bool</li>
<li>int</li>
<li>float (floating-point number, aka double)</li>
<li>string</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four compound types:</p>
<ul>
<li>array</li>
<li>object</li>
<li>callable</li>
<li>iterable</li>

<h3 id="operations-and-expressions"><a class="header" href="#operations-and-expressions">Operations and Expressions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PHP divides the operators in the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic operators</li>
<li>Assignment operators</li>
<li>Comparison operators</li>
<li>Increment/Decrement operators</li>
<li>Logical operators</li>
<li>String operators</li>
<li>Array operators</li>
<li>Conditional assignment operators</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arithmetic operators:</strong> <img src="pictures/arith_op.png" alt="Operators in PHP" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignment operators:</strong> <img src="pictures/assign.png" alt="Operators in PHP" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison operators:</strong> <img src="pictures/compare_op.png" alt="Operators in PHP" /></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Array operators:</strong> <img src="pictures/array_op.png" alt="Operators in PHP" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditional assignment operators:</strong> <img src="pictures/cond_op.png" alt="Operators in PHP" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost everything in a PHP script is an expression. Anything that has a value
is an expression. In a typical assignment statement ($x=100), a literal value,
a function or operands processed by operators is an expression, anything that
appears to the right of assignment operator (=)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">$x=100; //100 is an expression
$a=$b+$c; //b+$c is an expression
$c=add($a,$b); //add($a,$b) is an expresson

<h3 id="output"><a class="header" href="#output">Output</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>echo</code> &amp; <code>print</code> are used to output data to the screen in PHP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>echo</code> has no return value while <code>print</code> has a return value of 1 so it can be
used in expressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>echo</code> can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while
<code>print</code> can take one argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>echo</code> is marginally faster than <code>print</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
echo &quot;&lt;h2&gt;PHP is Fun!&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Hello world!&lt;br&gt;&quot;;

<li>
<p>In PHP <code>array()</code> function is used to create arrays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrays in PHP are homogenous that means they are a collection of only one

<li>
<p>An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the

<ul>
<li>
<p>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to
describe what you are searching for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text
replace operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of delimiters, a pattern and
optional modifiers. <code>$exp = &quot;/w3schools/i&quot;;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the example above, <code>/</code> is the usual delimiter, w3schools is the pattern
that is being searched for, and i is a modifier that makes the search
case-insensitive.</p>

<h3 id="cookies-1"><a class="header" href="#cookies-1">Cookies</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the
server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a
page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both
create and retrieve cookie values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cookie is created with the <code>setcookie()</code> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<p><code>setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);</code></p>
<p>Only the name parameter is required. All other parameters are optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In PHP we use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>isset()</code> function to check if the cookie is set.</li>
<li><code>setcookie()</code> to create of modify a cookie.</li>
<li><code>setcookie()</code> to delete a cookie with an old expiration date.</li>

<h3 id="session-tracking"><a class="header" href="#session-tracking">Session tracking</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across
multiple pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you
close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It
knows when you start the application and when you end. But on the internet
there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do,
because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used
across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default,
session variables last until the user closes the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to
all pages in one application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In PHP a session is started with the <code>session_start()</code> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: <code>$_SESSION</code></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Wireless Application Protocol (<strong>WAP</strong>) is a result of continuous work to
define an industry wide standard for developing applications over wireless
communication networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WML</strong> (Wireless Markup Language) is a markup language based on XML, and is
intended for use in specifying content and user interface for narrowband
devices, including cellular phones and pagers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WML</strong> is designed with the constraints of small narrowband devices in mind.
These constraints include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Small display and limited user input facilities</li>
<li>Narrowband network connection</li>
<li>Limited memory and computational resources.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WML</strong> includes four major functional areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text presentation and layout - <strong>WML</strong> includes text and image support,
including a variety of formatting and layout commands</li>
<li>Deck/card organisational metaphor - all information in <strong>WML</strong> is
organised into a collection of cards and decks</li>
<li>Inter-card navigation and linking - <strong>WML</strong> includes support for
explicitly managing the navigation between cards and decks</li>
<li>String parameterization and state management - all <strong>WML</strong> decks can be
parameterised, using a state model.&quot;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The topmost layer in the <strong>WAP</strong> (Wireless Application Protocol)
architecture is made up of WAE (Wireless Application Environment), which
consists of WML and WML scripting language.</p>
<ul>
<li>WML stands for Wireless Markup Language</li>
<li>WML is an application of XML, which is defined in a document-type
definition.</li>
<li>WML is based on HDML and is modified so that it can be compared with
HTML.</li>
<li>WML takes care of the small screen and the low bandwidth of
transmission.</li>
<li>WML is the markup language defined in the <strong>WAP</strong> specification.</li>
<li><strong>WAP</strong> sites are written in WML, while web sites are written in HTML.</li>
<li>WML is very similar to HTML. Both of them use tags and are written in
plain text format.</li>
<li>WML files have the extension &quot;.wml&quot;. The MIME type of WML is
&quot;text/vnd.wap.wml&quot;.</li>
<li>WML supports client-side scripting. The scripting language supported is

It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of
the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for
every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its
standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally,
libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making
blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network,
accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and
wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the
response comes back.</p>

higher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses of <strong>Ruby</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Web development:</strong> Web development is one of Ruby's claims to fame
because of the popular web development framework Ruby on Rails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static site generation:</strong> Most websites use server-side code that
generates HTML and serves it to your browser when you visit a page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevOps and automation:</strong> Vagrant, written in Ruby, is a tool for
managing virtual machines from command line. It allows developers to
code and run projects developed for a specific operating system run on
any operating system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web servers:</strong> You can also use Ruby to build web servers. Passenger,
Unicorn, and Puma are web servers written in Ruby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data processing:</strong> Ruby's built-in map, reduce, and select functions
are powerful tools used to solve many data processing problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web scraping and crawling:</strong> Ruby has a wide variety of packages like
vessel &amp; nokogiri that make extracting data from web pages a breeze.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scalar-types-and-their-operations"><a class="header" href="#scalar-types-and-their-operations">Scalar types and their operations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scalar types in Ruby:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strings:</strong> A string is made up of multiple characters. They are defined
by enclosing a set of characters within single (‘x’) or double (“x”)
quotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Numbers:</strong> A number is a series of digits that use a dot as a decimal
mark (where one is required). Integers and floats are the two main kinds
of numbers; Ruby can handle them both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Booleans:</strong> The Boolean data type represents only one bit of information
that says whether the value is true or false. A value of this data type is
returned when two values are compared.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simple-input-and-output"><a class="header" href="#simple-input-and-output">Simple input and output</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ruby writing to console:</strong>
Ruby has several methods for printing output on the console. These methods are
part of the Kernel module. Methods of the Kernel are available to all objects
in Ruby.</p>
<!-- CODE -->
<pre><code class="language-ruby">print &quot;Apple &quot;
print &quot;Apple\n&quot;

puts &quot;Orange&quot;
puts &quot;Orange&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>print</strong> and <strong>puts</strong> methods produce textual output on the console. The difference
between the two is that the latter(puts) adds a new line character, whereas in
you have to explicitly add a newline(&quot;\n&quot;) character to print a newline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruby has 3 more methods to print outptut:</p>
<!-- CODE -->
<pre><code class="language-ruby">p &quot;Lemon&quot;
p &quot;Lemon&quot;

printf &quot;There are %d apples\n&quot;, 3

putc 'K'
putc 0xA
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>p</strong> calls the inspect method upon the object being printed. The method
is useful for debugging.</li>
<li>The <strong>printf</strong> method is well known from the C programming language. It
enables string formatting.</li>
<li>The <strong>putc</strong> method prints one character to the console. The second line
prints a newline. The 0xA is a hexadecimal code for the newline
character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruby reading input from console</p>
<ul>
<li>The $stdin is a global variable that holds a stream for the standard
input. It can be used to read input from the console.<!-- CODE -->
<pre><code class="language-ruby">inp = $stdin.read
puts inp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>We use the read method to read input from the console: <code>inp = $stdin.read</code></li>
<li>The read method reads data from the standard input until it reaches the
EOF(end of the file).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>An extremely productive web-application framework.</li>
<li>Written in Ruby by David Heinemeier Hansson.</li>
<li>You could develop a web application at least ten times faster with Rails
than you could with a typical Java framework.</li>
<li>An open source Ruby framework for developing database-backed web
applications.</li>
<li>Configure your code with Database Schema.</li>
<li>No compilation phase required.</li>
<li>Full Stack Framework
<ul>
<li>Includes everything needed to create a database-driven web application,
using the Model-View-Controller pattern.</li>
<li>Being a full-stack framework means all the layers are built to work
seamlessly together with less code.</li>
<li>Requires fewer lines of code than other frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview-of-rails"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-rails">Overview of Rails</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Rails is packed with features that make you more productive, with many of
the following features building on one other.
<ul>
<li><strong>Metaprogramming:</strong>
Where other frameworks use extensive code generation from scratch, Rail
framework uses Metaprogramming techniques to write programs. Ruby is one
of the best languages for Metaprogramming, and Rails uses this capability
well. Rails also uses code generation but relies much more on
Metaprogramming for the heavy lifting.</li>
<li><strong>Active Record:</strong>
Rails introduces the Active Record framework, which saves objects into the
database. The Rails version of the Active Record discovers the columns in
a database schema and automatically attaches them to your domain objects
using metaprogramming.</li>
<li><strong>Convention over configuration:</strong>
Most web development frameworks for .NET or Java force you to write pages
of configuration code. If you follow the suggested naming conventions,
Rails doesn't need much configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong>
You often create temporary code in the early stages of development to help
get an application up quickly and see how major components work together.
Rails automatically creates much of the scaffolding you'll need.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in testing:</strong>
Rails creates simple automated tests you can then extend. Rails also
provides supporting code called harnesses and fixtures that make test
cases easier to write and run. Ruby can then execute all your automated
tests with the rake utility.</li>
<li><strong>Three environments:</strong>
Rails gives you three default environments: development, testing, and
production. Each behaves slightly differently, making your entire software
development cycle easier. For example, Rails creates a fresh copy of the
Test database for each test run.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>How Rails Implements Ajax</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rails has a simple, consistent model for how it implements Ajax operations.
Once the browser has rendered and displayed the initial web page, different
user actions cause it to display a new web page (like any traditional web
application) or trigger an Ajax operation −</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some trigger fires − This trigger could be the user clicking on a button or
link, the user making changes to the data on a form or in a field, or just a
periodic trigger (based on a timer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web client calls the server − A JavaScript method, XMLHttpRequest, sends
data associated with the trigger to an action handler on the server. The
data might be the ID of a checkbox, the text in an entry field, or a whole
form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server does processing − The server-side action handler ( Rails
controller action )-- does something with the data and returns an HTML
fragment to the web client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client receives the response − The client-side JavaScript, which Rails
creates automatically, receives the HTML fragment and uses it to update a
specified part of the current page's HTML, often the content of a <div> tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These steps are the simplest way to use Ajax in a Rails application, but
with a little extra work, you can have the server return any kind of data in
response to an Ajax request, and you can create custom JavaScript in the
browser to perform more involved interactions.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-ejb"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-ejb">Introduction to EJB</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>EJB</strong> is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic
of an application. An EJB web container provides a runtime environment for
web related software components, including computer security, Java servlet
lifecycle management, transaction processing, and other web services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When to use Enterprise Java Beans?</p>
<ol>
<li>Application needs Remote Access. In other words, it is distributed.</li>
<li>Application needs to be scalable. EJB applications supports load
balancing, clustering and fail-over.</li>
<li>Application needs encapsulated business logic. EJB application is
differentiated from demonstration and persistent layer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantages of Enterprise Java Beans</p>
<ol>
<li>EJB repository yields system-level services to enterprise beans, the
bean developer can focus on solving business problems.</li>
<li>The beans rather than the clients contain the application’s business
logic, the client developer can focus on the presentation of the client. The
client developer does not have to code the pattern that execute business
rules or access databases.</li>
<li>Enterprise Java Beans are portable elements, the application assembler
can build new applications from the beans that already exists.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disadvantages of Enterprise Java Beans</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires application server</li>
<li>Requires only java client. For other language client, you need to go for
webservice.</li>
<li>Complex to understand and develop EJB applications.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3 Types of Enterprise Java Beans are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Session Bean:</strong> Session bean contains business logic that can be
invoked by local, remote or webservice client. There are two types of
session beans:
<ol>
<li>Stateful Session bean : Stateful session bean performs business task
with the help of a state.</li>
<li>Stateless Session bean : Stateless session bean implement business
logic without having a persistent storage mechanism, such as a state or
database and can used shared data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Message Driven Bean:</strong> Like Session Bean, it contains the business
logic but it is invoked by passing message.</li>
<li><strong>Entity Bean:</strong> It summarizes the state that can be remained in the
database. It is deprecated. Now, it is replaced with JPA (Java Persistent
API). There are two types of entity bean:
<ol>
<li>Bean Managed Persistence : In a bean managed persistence type of
entity bean, the programmer has to write the code for database calls. It
persists across multiple sessions and multiple clients.</li>
<li>Container Managed Persistence : Container managed persistence are
enterprise bean that persists across database. In container managed
persistence the container take care of database calls.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2. What is the use of the XmlHttpRequest object? Explain its use with the help
of simple javascript code.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can
retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This
enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the
user is doing. XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XMLHttpRequest Example: When you type a character in the input field below,
an XMLHttpRequest is sent to the server, and some name suggestions are
returned (from the server):</p>
<p><img src="pictures/xhr_example.png" alt="xhr example" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">    // Create an xhr object
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // specify the function to execute when xhr object's status changes
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    // When readyState is 4 and status is 200 then response is ready
      if (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200) {
    // The responseText property returns the server response as a text string
         document.getElementById(&quot;demo&quot;).innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
      }
  };
  xhttp.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;filename&quot;, true);
  xhttp.send();
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3. Draw and explain how AJAX works with the help of suitable examples.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small
amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is
possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How AJAX works:</p>
<p><img src="pictures/ajax_working.gif" alt="ajax working" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>AJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest.</li>
<li>Google Suggest is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface:
When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the
letters off to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Write a program of your choice that demonstrates use of properties of DOM.
Also list the limitations of using XML.</strong></p>
<!-- TODO -->
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>NEEDS REFACTORING</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (<strong>XML</strong>) is a markup language and file format for
storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set
of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and
machine-readable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitations of <strong>XML</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>XML syntax is verbose and redundant compared to other text-based data
transmission formats such as JSON.</li>
<li>The redundancy in syntax of XML causes higher storage and transportation
cost when the volume of data is large.</li>
<li>XML document is less readable compared to other text-based data
transmission formats such as JSON.</li>
<li>XML doesn’t support array.</li>
<li>XML file sizes are usually very large due to its verbose nature, it is
totally dependant on who is writing it.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>5. How to use interceptors in strut 2? List and describe important
interceptors provided by strut 2 framework.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Interceptor</strong> is an object that is invoked at the preprocessing and
postprocessing of a request. In Struts 2, interceptor is used to perform
operations such as validation, exception handling, internationalization,
displaying intermediate result etc.</p>

<p><strong>6. What are the web services? List and explain types and components of web
services.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over
a network. It is a software function provided at a network address over the
Web with the service always-on as in the concept of utility computing. Many
organizations use multiple software systems for management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Components(Types) of Web Services</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):</strong> SOAP stands for “Simple Object
Access Protocol.” It is a transport-independent messaging protocol. SOAP
is built on sending XML data in the form of SOAP Messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration):</strong> UDDI is a
standard for specifying, publishing and discovering a service provider’s
online services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WSDL (Web Services Description Language):</strong> If a web service can’t be
found, it can’t be used. The client invoking the web service should be
aware of the location of the web service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>REST(Representational State Transfer):</strong>
Is an architectural style, meaning each unique URL represents an individual
object of some sort. A REST web service uses HTTP and supports/repurposes
several HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT or DELETE. It also offers simple
CRUD-oriented services. Fun fact: The original RESTful architecture was
designed by one of the leading authors of HTTP, Roy Fielding.</p>

<p><strong>7. What different configuration files are required to develop any struts
application?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configuration files like <strong>web.xml, struts.xml, strutsconfig.xml</strong> and
<strong>struts.properties</strong> required to develop any struts application:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>web.xml</strong> configuration file is a J2EE configuration file that
determines how elements of the HTTP request are processed by the servlet
container.</li>
<li>The <strong>struts.xml</strong> file contains the configuration information that you
will be modifying as actions are developed.</li>
<li>The <strong>struts-config.xml</strong> configuration file is a link between the View
and Model components in the Web Client but you would not have to touch
these settings for 99.99% of your projects.</li>
<li>The <strong>struts.properties</strong> configuration file provides a mechanism to
change the default behavior of the framework.</li>

<p><strong>8. What are enterprise java beans? Draw and explain main components of EJB
architecture.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic of an
application. An EJB web container provides a runtime environment for web
related software components, including computer security, Java servlet
lifecycle management, transaction processing, and other web services.</p>

<p><strong>9. Explain what is Angular Expression? Explain what is the key difference
between angular expressions and JavaScript expressions?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AngularJS Expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression
}}.</li>
<li>AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive:
ng-bind=&quot;expression&quot;.</li>
<li>AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where
the expression is written.</li>
<li>Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + &quot; &quot; + lastName }}</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key difference: Like JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can contain
literals, operators, and variables. Unlike JavaScript expressions, AngularJS
expressions can be written inside HTML. AngularJS expressions do not support
conditionals, loops, and exceptions, while JavaScript expressions do.</p>

<p><strong>13. What is EJB? Explain types of EJB? Also explain uses of Ruby.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Refer question 8 for <strong>EJB</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3 Types of Enterprise Java Beans are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Session Bean:</strong> Session bean contains business logic that can be invoked
by local, remote or webservice client. There are two types of session beans:
<ol>
<li>Stateful Session bean : Stateful session bean performs business task
with the help of a state.</li>
<li>Stateless Session bean : Stateless session bean implement business
logic without having a persistent storage mechanism, such as a state or
database and can used shared data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Message Driven Bean:</strong> Like Session Bean, it contains the business logic
but it is invoked by passing message.</li>
<li><strong>Entity Bean:</strong> It summarizes the state that can be remained in the
database. It is deprecated. Now, it is replaced with JPA (Java Persistent
API). There are two types of entity bean:
<ol>
<li>Bean Managed Persistence : In a bean managed persistence type of
entity bean, the programmer has to write the code for database calls. It
persists across multiple sessions and multiple clients.</li>
<li>Container Managed Persistence : Container managed persistence are
enterprise bean that persists across database. In container managed
persistence the container take care of database calls.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong> is an open-source programming language. It is also referred to as
scripting language that is dynamic, interpreted and object-oriented as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses of <strong>Ruby</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Web development:</strong> Web development is one of Ruby's claims to fame
because of the popular web development framework Ruby on Rails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static site generation:</strong> Most websites use server-side code that
generates HTML and serves it to your browser when you visit a page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevOps and automation:</strong> Vagrant, written in Ruby, is a tool for
managing virtual machines from command line. It allows developers to
code and run projects developed for a specific operating system run on
any operating system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web servers:</strong> You can also use Ruby to build web servers. Passenger,
Unicorn, and Puma are web servers written in Ruby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data processing:</strong> Ruby's built-in map, reduce, and select functions
are powerful tools used to solve many data processing problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web scraping and crawling:</strong> Ruby has a wide variety of packages like
vessel &amp; nokogiri that make extracting data from web pages a breeze.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>15. Explain how Rails implements AJAX? Mention what are the positive aspects
of Rails.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How Rails Implements Ajax:</strong> Rails has a simple, consistent model for how
it implements Ajax operations. Once the browser has rendered and displayed
the initial web page, different user actions cause it to display a new web
page (like any traditional web application) or trigger an Ajax operation −</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Some trigger fires:</strong> This trigger could be the user clicking on a
button or link, the user making changes to the data on a form or in a
field, or just a periodic trigger (based on a timer).</li>
<li><strong>The web client calls the server:</strong> A JavaScript method,
XMLHttpRequest, sends data associated with the trigger to an action
handler on the server. The data might be the ID of a checkbox, the text
in an entry field, or a whole form.</li>
<li><strong>The server does processing:</strong> The server-side action handler ( Rails
controller action )-- does something with the data and returns an HTML
fragment to the web client.</li>
<li><strong>The client receives the response:</strong> The client-side JavaScript, which
Rails creates automatically, receives the HTML fragment and uses it to
update a specified part of the current page's HTML, often the content of
a <div> tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pros of <strong>Rails:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Time efficiency</li>
<li>A great number of helpful tools and libraries</li>
<li>Huge and active community</li>
<li>Strong adherence to standards</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Rake</strong> is Ruby Make, a standalone Ruby utility that replaces the Unix utility 'make', and uses a 'Rakefile' and .rake files to build up a list of tasks. In Rails, Rake is used for common administration tasks, especially sophisticated ones that build off of each other.</p>
