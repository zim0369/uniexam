<h2 id="adversarial-search"><a class="header" href="#adversarial-search">Adversarial Search</a></h2>
<p><strong>Adversarial search is a search, where we examine the problem which arises when
we try to plan ahead of the world and other agents are planning against us.</strong></p>
<p>The environment with more than one agent is termed as multi-agent environment,
in which each agent is an opponent of other agent and playing against each
other. Each agent needs to consider the action of other agent and effect of that
action on their performance.</p>
<p>Searches in which two or more players with conflicting goals are trying to
explore the same search space for the solution, are called adversarial searches,
often known as Games.</p>
<p>Games are modeled as a Search problem and heuristic evaluation function, and
these are the two main factors which help to model and solve games in AI.</p>

<p><strong>Games are usually intriguing because they are difficult to solve. Chess, for
example, has an average branching factor of around 35, and games frequently
stretch to 50 moves per player, therefore the search tree has roughly 35100 or
10154 nodes (despite the search graph having “only” about 1040 unique nodes). As
a result, games, like the real world, necessitate the ability to make some sort
of decision even when calculating the best option is impossible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The optimal strategy can be found from the minimax value of each node, which
we express as MINIMAX, given a game tree (n). Assuming that both players
play optimally from there through the finish of the game, the utility (for
MAX) of being in the corresponding state is the node's minimax value.</p>

<p><strong>Alpha-beta pruning is a modified version of the minimax algorithm. It is an
optimization technique for the minimax algorithm.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The two-parameter can be defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha</strong>: The best (highest-value) choice we have found so far at any
point along the path of Maximizer. The initial value of alpha is <strong>-∞</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Beta</strong>: The best (lowest-value) choice we have found so far at any
point along the path of Minimizer. The initial value of beta is <strong>+∞</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Alpha-beta pruning to a standard minimax algorithm returns the same move
as the standard algorithm does, but it removes all the nodes which are not
really affecting the final decision but making algorithm slow. Hence by
pruning these nodes, it makes the algorithm fas</p>

<p><strong>Monte Carlo tree search is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of
decision processes, most notably those employed in software that plays board
games. In that context MCTS is used to solve the game tree.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MCTS can be broken down into 4 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>: In this process, the MCTS algorithm traverses the current
tree from the root node using a specific strategy. The strategy uses an
evaluation function to optimally select nodes with the highest estimated
value.</p>
<p><img src="pictures/mcts_formula.png" alt="MCTS formula" /></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Si = value of a node i</li>
<li>xi = empirical mean of a node i</li>
<li>C = a constant</li>
<li>t = total number of simulations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expansion</strong>: In this process, a new child node is added to the tree to
that node which was optimally reached during the selection process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulation</strong>: In this process, a simulation is performed by choosing
moves or strategies until a result or predefined state is achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backpropagation</strong>: After determining the value of the newly added
node, the remaining tree must be updated. During the process, the number of
simulation stored in each node is incremented. Also, if the new node’s
simulation results in a win, then the number of wins is also incremented.</p>

<h2 id="adopting-virtualization"><a class="header" href="#adopting-virtualization">Adopting Virtualization</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some users may confuse virtualization with cloud computing, but they’re not
entirely the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization is the creation of a virtual resource such as a server,
desktop, operating system, file, storage space, or network to help
businesses manage and scale workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud computing is the sharing of resources, software, applications and
data as a service. Together, the two can be used to provide even greater
advantages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data virtualization is viable for small businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While virtualization was first embraced by enterprise operations, it soon
became clear that the same value proposition held substantial benefits for
Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs). Cyberattacks and natural disasters can
hit businesses of all sizes. For SMBs, backing up a virtualized
infrastructure can be a more viable option to backing up hardware servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasons to adopt virtualization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased agility for the business</li>
<li>Better resource deployment</li>
<li>Greater operational efficiency</li>
<li>Enhanced security</li>
<li>Higher availability</li>

delivering a virtual -- rather than physical -- version of something, such
as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network

<h3 id="virtualization-software"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-software">Virtualization software</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization software, also called hypervisor, allows a single host
computer to create and run one or more virtual environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization software is most often used to emulate a complete computer
system in order to allow a guest operating system to be run, for example
allowing Linux to run as a guest on top of a PC that is natively running a
Microsoft Windows operating system (or the inverse, running Windows as a
guest on Linux).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses of virtualization software:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Back up</strong>: You can backup your entire operating system or server
installation as a virtual OS.</li>
<li><strong>Run a different OS</strong>: Let's say you want to try out Linux without
having to install it on a physical hard drive.</li>
<li><strong>Run ancient apps</strong>: Say an application you want to run only works on
win8 and you're using win10 then instead of reinstalling an outdated OS on
real hardware why not just install windows 8 in a VM.</li>
<li><strong>Look at dirty files</strong>: Taking a look at malicious files might put your
computer and your data at risk so it would be better to check it in a
sandboxed environment.</li>
<li><strong>Using sandboxed browsers</strong>: Hackers have successfully exploited all
four of most popular browsers — Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
Safari. Browser plugins can be malicious too. In this case using a sandboxed
browser like the TOR browser is safer.</li>
<li><strong>Try an application</strong>: You just want to check if an application you
wrote works well on multiple operating systems then using virtual machines
would be more convenient as compared to installing on real hardware.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Grid computing is also called as &quot;distributed computing.&quot; It links multiple
computing resources (PC's, workstations, servers, and storage elements)
together and provides a mechanism to access them.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The main usage of Virtualization Technology is to provide the applications
with the standard versions to their cloud users, suppose if the next version
of that application is released, then cloud provider has to provide the
latest version to their cloud users and practically it is possible because
it is more expensive.</p>

<li>
<p>Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, is a collection of
security measures designed to protect cloud-based infrastructure,
applications, and data. These measures ensure user and device
authentication, data and resource access control, and data privacy
protection. They also support regulatory data compliance. Cloud security is
employed in cloud environments to protect a company's data from distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, hackers, and unauthorized user
access or use.</p>

<ol>
<li>Public</li>
<li>Private</li>
<li>Hybrid</li>

<p>Cloud security is critical since most organizations are already using cloud
computing in one form or another. This high rate of adoption of public cloud
services is reflected in Gartner’s recent prediction that the worldwide
market for public cloud services will grow 23.1% in 2021.</p>

<p>Virtualized security, or security virtualization, refers to security
solutions that are software-based and designed to work within a virtualized

<ul>
<li>
<p>Anatomy of Cloud Computing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Provisioning and Configuration Module:</strong> It is the lowest level of
cloud and typically resides on bare hardware (as a firmware) or on the
top of the hypervisor layer. Its function is to abstract the underlying
hardware and provide a standard mechanism to spawn instance of virtual
machine on demand. It also handles the post-configuration of the
operating systems and applications residing on the VM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Optimization:</strong> This layer handles the monitoring of
all services, storage, networking and applications components in cloud.
Based on the statistics, it could perform routine functions that
optimize the behavior of the infrastructure components and provide
relevant data to the cloud administrator to further optimize the
configuration for maximum utilization and performance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metering and Chargeback:</strong> This layer provides functions to measure
the usage of resources in cloud. The metering module collects all the
utilization data per domain per use. This module gives the cloud
administrator enough data to measure ongoing utilization of resources
and to create invoices based on the usage on a periodic basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Orchestration is a central to cloud operations.
Orchestration converts requests from the service management layer and
the monitoring, chargeback modules to appropriate action item which are
then submitted to provisioning and configuration module for final
closure. Orchestration updates the CMDB in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration Management Database (CMDB):</strong> It is a central
configuration repository wherein all the meta data and configuration of
different modules, resources are kept and updated in the real-time
basis. The repository can then be accessed using standards protocols
like SOAP by third-party software and integration components. All
updates in CMDB happen in real time as requests get processed in cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Life cycle Management Layer (CLM):</strong> This layer handles the
coordination of all other layers in cloud. All requests internal and
external are addressed to the CLM layer first. CLM may internally route
requests and actions to other layers for further processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Catalog:</strong> It is central to the definition of cloud, SC
defines what kind of services the cloud is capable of providing and at
what cost to the end user. SC is the first thing that is drafted before
a cloud is architecture. The service management layer consults SC before
it processes any request for a new resource.</p>

<p><strong>Data Management and Data Transfer:</strong> To run HPC applications in the AWS
cloud, you need to move the required data into the cloud. There are several data
transport solutions designed to securely transfer huge amounts of data. This
overcomes issues like a long time for transfer, high network costs, and security
concerns. Also, you can automate the movement of data between the AWS cloud and
on-premises storage. There are options for establishing a private connection to
the AWS from your premises. This increases bandwidth to provide more throughput,
reduces the cost of the network, and provides a consistent network experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compute &amp; Networking:</strong> There are several compute instances types that can
be customized according to your needs. It also handles monitoring your
application and adjusting its capacity for maintaining a steady and predictable
performance at an affordable cost. Also, setting up application scaling across
multiple services for multiple resources takes a few minutes. Enhanced
networking options from AWS allow achieving lower inter-instance latency and
higher bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> When looking for an HPC solution, you need to consider the

<p>Cloud computing is an emerging technology that provides various computing
services on demand. It provides convenient access to a shared pool of
higher-level services and other system resources. Nowadays, cloud computing
has a great significance in the fields of geology, biology, and other
scientific research areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protein structure prediction is the best example in research area that makes
use of cloud applications for its computation and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A protein is composed of long chains of amino acids joined together by
peptide bonds. The various structures of protein help in the designing of
new drugs and the various sequences of proteins from its three-dimensional
structure in predictive form is known as a Protein structure prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly primary structures of proteins are formed and then prediction of the
secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures are done from the primary one.
In this way predictions of protein structures are done. Protein structure
prediction also makes use of various other technologies like artificial
neural networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning and probabilistic
techniques, also holds great importance in fields like theoretical chemistry
and bioinformatics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are various algorithms and tools that exists for protein structure
prediction. CASP (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) is a
well-known tool that provides methods for automated web servers and the
results of research work are placed on clouds like CAMEO (Continuous
Automated Model Evaluation) server. These servers can be accessed by anyone
as per their requirements from any place. Some of the tools or servers used
in protein structure prediction are Phobius, FoldX, LOMETS, Prime, Predict
protein, SignalP, BBSP, EVfold, Biskit, HHpred, Phre, ESyired3D. Using these
tools new structures are predicted and the results are placed on the
cloud-based servers.</p>

artificial satellites. Firstly, the photographs are taken in digital form
and later are processed by the computers to extract the information.
Statistical methods are applied to the digital images and after processing
the various discrete surfaces are identified by analyzing the pixel values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Majorly there are four kinds of resolutions associated with satellite
imagery. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial resolution:</strong> It is determined by the sensors Instantaneous
Field of View(IFoV) and is defined as the pixel size of an image that is
visible to the human eye being measured on the ground. Since it has high
resolving power or the ability to separate and hence is termed as
Spatial Resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral resolution:</strong> This resolution measures the wavelength
internal size and determines the number of wavelength intervals that the
sensor measures.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal resolution:</strong> The word temporal is associated with time or
days and is defined as the time that passes between various imagery
cloud periods.</li>
<li><strong>Radiometric resolution:</strong> This resolution provides the actual
characteristics of the image and is generally expressed in bits size. It
gives the effective bit depth and records the various levels of
brightness of imaging system.</li>

<h4 id="social-networking"><a class="header" href="#social-networking">Social Networking</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social networks help boost internet usability by storing heavy multimedia
content in cloud storage systems. Videos and photographs are the most
popular content on social media, which essentially use up the maximum space
allocated to them. They have the capacity to slow down applications and
servers with all of their resource demands. Cloud computing vendors such as
Salesforce and Amazon nowadays provide varied services including Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). As
they deliver these things through cloud servers, clients can use the
flexibility and scalability of the system without purchasing standalone
software or hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from data storage, the social networks are now also using clouds for
various other tasks. For example, this can be ideal for big data analytics.
One of the benefits of using cloud systems is that users can access vast
amount of structured and even non-structured data easily. Just take a look
at the much-improved analytics provided by sites like Facebook, especially
for its business users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way cloud computing becomes helpful is by reducing the cost of data
backup and recovery in case of a disaster. If the data is only stored in one
central location, it becomes much riskier. If something happens there, it is
almost impossible to recover the data. But through cloud they remain
accessible through shared resources across the globe. This is especially
useful for social networks as the store personal data of its users, and so
cannot afford to lose even one part of it.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-risks-in-cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#types-of-risks-in-cloud-computing">Types of Risks in Cloud Computing</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of cloud
computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process in which
data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user, software, or
application. In a cloud computing environment, data loss occurs when our
sensitive data is somebody else's hands, one or more data elements can not be
utilized by the data owner, hard disk is not working properly, and software is
not updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs:</strong> As we all know, cloud computing is
completely depends on Internet, so it is compulsory to protect interfaces and
APIs that are used by external users. APIs are the easiest way to communicate
with most of the cloud services. In cloud computing, few services are available
in the public domain. These services can be accessed by third parties, so there
may be a chance that these services easily harmed and hacked by hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Data Breach is the process in which the confidential data
is viewed, accessed, or stolen by the third party without any authorization, so
organization's data is hacked by the hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Vendor lock-in is the of the biggest security risks in
cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their
services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different
platforms, that can cause difficulty moving one cloud to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased complexity strains IT staff:</strong> Migrating, integrating, and
operating the cloud services is complex for the IT staff. IT staff must require
the extra capability and skills to manage, integrate, and maintain the data to
the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectre &amp; Meltdown:</strong> Spectre &amp; Meltdown allows programs to view and steal
data which is currently processed on computer. It can run on personal computers,
mobile devices, and in the cloud. It can store the password, your personal
information such as images, emails, and business documents in the memory of
other running programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Denial of service (DoS) attacks occur
when the system receives too much traffic to buffer the server. Mostly, DoS
attackers target web servers of large organizations such as banking sectors,
media companies, and government organizations. To recover the lost data, DoS
attackers charge a great deal of time and money to handle the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account hijacking:</strong> Account hijacking is a serious security risk in cloud
computing. It is the process in which individual user's or organization's cloud
account (bank account, e-mail account, and social media account) is stolen by
hackers. The hackers use the stolen account to perform unauthorized activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-security-in-cloud"><a class="header" href="#data-security-in-cloud">Data Security in Cloud</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The core principles of information security and data governance—data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (known as the CIA triad)—also
apply to the cloud:
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> protecting the data from unauthorized access and
disclosure</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> safeguard the data from unauthorized modification so it
can be trusted</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> ensuring the data is fully available and accessible
when it’s needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-issues"><a class="header" href="#security-issues">Security Issues</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data Loss is one of the issues faced in Cloud Computing. This
is also known as Data Leakage. As we know that our sensitive data is in the
hands of Somebody else, and we don’t have full control over our database. So if
the security of cloud service is to break by hackers then it may be possible
that hackers will get access to our sensitive data or personal files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interference of Hackers and Insecure API’s:</strong> As we know if we are talking
about the cloud and its services it means we are talking about the Internet.
Also, we know that the easiest way to communicate with Cloud is using API. So it
is important to protect the Interface’s and API’s which are used by an external
user. But also in cloud computing, few services are available in the public
domain. An is the vulnerable part of Cloud Computing because it may be possible
that these services are accessed by some third parties. So it may be possible
that with the help of these services hackers can easily hack or harm our data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Account Hijacking:</strong> Account Hijacking is the most serious security
issue in Cloud Computing. If somehow the Account of User or an Organization is
hijacked by Hacker. Then the hacker has full authority to perform Unauthorized
Activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Service Provider:</strong> Vendor lock In is also an important Security
issue in Cloud Computing. Many organizations will face different problems while
shifting from one vendor to another. For example, An Organization wants to shift
from AWS Cloud to Google Cloud Services then they ace various problem’s like
shifting of all data, also both cloud services have different techniques and
functions, so they also face problems regarding that. Also, it may be possible
that the charges of AWS are different from Google Cloud, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Skill:</strong> While working, shifting o another service provider, need
an extra feature, how to use a feature, etc. are the main problems caused in IT
Company who doesn’t have skilled Employee. So it requires a skilled person to
work with cloud Computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack:</strong> This type of attack occurs when the
system receives too much traffic. Mostly DoS attacks occur in large
organizations such as the banking sector, government sector, etc. When a DoS
attack occurs data is lost. So in order to recover data, it requires a great
amount of money as well as time to handle it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges"><a class="header" href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DDoS and Denial-of-Service Attacks:</strong> As more and more businesses and
operations move to the cloud, cloud providers are becoming a bigger target for
malicious attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are more common
than ever before. Verisign reported IT services, cloud platforms (PaaS) and SaaS
was the most frequently targeted industry during the first quarter of 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data breaches:</strong> Known data breaches in the U.S. hit a record-high of 738
in 2014, according to the Identity Theft Research Center, and hacking was (by
far) the number one cause. That’s an incredible statistic and only emphasizes
the growing challenge to secure sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data loss:</strong> When business critical information is moved into the cloud,
it’s understandable to be concerned with its security. Losing cloud data, either
through accidental deletion and human error, malicious tampering including the
installation of malware (i.e. DDoS), or an act of nature that brings down a
cloud service provider, could be disastrous for an enterprise business. Often a
DDoS attack is only a diversion for a greater threat, such as an attempt to
steal or delete data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure access control points:</strong> One of the great benefits of the cloud
is it can be accessed from anywhere and from any device. But, what if the
interfaces and particularly the application programming interfaces (APIs) users
interact with aren’t secure? Hackers can find and gain access to these types of
vulnerabilities and exploit authentication via APIs if given enough time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifications and alerts:</strong> Awareness and proper communication of security
threats is a cornerstone of network security and the same goes for cloud
computing security. Alerting the appropriate website or application managers as
soon as a threat is identified should be part of a thorough data security and
access management plan. Speedy mitigation of a threat relies on clear and prompt
communication so steps can be taken by the proper entities and impact of the
threat minimized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages"><a class="header" href="#advantages">Advantages</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>24×7 Visibility:</strong> The best cloud security solutions like AppTrana enable
24×7 monitoring of the application and cloud-based assets. This helps
organizations to have continuous visibility into their risk posture and its
impact on the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher Availability:</strong> Cloud computing security solutions typically have
built-in redundancies to ensure that the application/ resources are always
available. The CDNs used have distributed global networks of edge servers that
deliver content optimally, accelerate application performance, and minimize
access to the server. Together, they handle traffic surges in a way that
on-premises/ hardware solutions cannot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effective protection against DDoS Attacks:</strong> Cloud security solutions
provide the most effective protection against DDoS attacks, which are increasing
in numbers, magnitude, sophistication, and severity. Cloud computing security
helps to continuously monitor, identify, analyze, and mitigate DDoS attacks. The
built-in redundancies, customizability, flexibility, scalability, and
intelligence of such solutions can prevent volumetric, low, and slow attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Security:</strong> The best cloud computing security solutions provide data
security by design. They have security protocols and policies such as strong
access controls and data encryption to prevent unauthorized entities from
accessing confidential information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay as you Go Model:</strong> The cloud security model ensures that you pay only
for what you use and consume as opposed to making any upfront investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced Threat Detection:</strong> By using end-point scanning and global threat
intelligence, cloud computing security can detect threats more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Top-notch cloud application security providers
help to ensure regulatory standards and industry-specific compliance needs. This
is done through its enhanced infrastructure and managed security services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages">Disadvantages</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of data confidentiality:</strong> There is always a risk that user data can
be accessed by other people. So data and cloud protection must be good because
if it won’t be dangerous for data confidentiality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depends on internet connection:</strong> The internet is the only way to cloud
computing. When there is no internet connection in your place, or the internet
path to the cloud provider is in trouble, automatically access to your cloud
computing machine will be disconnected. Now this is where the biggest obstacle
is happening in developing countries and remote areas that do not have good
internet access.And the weakness of public cloud is where everyone accesses the
same server and server and will increase the risk of attack, and down the
server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The level of security:</strong> Secrecy and security are among the most doubtful
things in cloud computing. By using a cloud computing system means we are fully
entrusted with the security and confidentiality of data to companies that
provide cloud computing servers. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue
the server for errors in the data. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue
the server for errors in the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance:</strong> Which refers to the risk of a level compliance deviation
from the provider against the regulations applied by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerable in the event of an attack:</strong> There are lots of arguments
against cloud computing one of which is computing because the Cloud Computing
work system is online, each component that is on Cloud Computing can be exposed
to a wide range, this is a wide open opportunity for attacks on data or
activities stored on the server. When an attack is carried out by hackers, the
problems that occur are data security, and data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Mobility:</strong> which refers to the possibility of sharing data between
cloud services and how to retrieve data if one day the user makes a process of
terminating cloud computing services.And there is local storage where the data
can be used at any time as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical problem:</strong> Besides that the use of Cloud Computing makes you
unable to manage it yourself when there is a problem or a problem, you must
contact customer support who is not necessarily ready 24/7. This is a problem
because for some support you also have to pay more money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low Connection:</strong> Does not work well if the connection is slow. The
quality of cloud computing servers is one of the most important considerations
before we decide to provide cloud computing server service providers. When the
server is down or the permorma is not good, we will be harmed because of poor
server quality.</p>

<p><strong>Top-of-the-Line Perimeter Firewall:</strong> Most firewalls are very simple—they
typically inspect a packet’s source and destination and that’s all. Some more
advanced firewalls feature stable packet inspection, which checks the integrity
of the file packets for stability issues prior to approving or rejecting the
packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems with Event Logging:</strong> Numerous IT security
compliance standards require businesses to have a means of tracking and

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid/ Multi-Cloud Solutions:</strong> Hybrid cloud computing refers to using a
combination of the private cloud as well as a third-party public cloud
service. It is primarily used to allow workloads to move between private and
public clouds, giving users more flexibility with their computing needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup And Disaster Recovery:</strong> Cyber attacks, data outages, and system
failures are a part and parcel of running a business these days. Most
businesses have dealt with their servers crashing, leading to loss of
critical data files. To ensure such issues don’t damage the organization and
its processes, backup and disaster recovery has become a trending use case
of the cloud. If Spiceworks reports are to be believed, 15% of the cloud
budget is allocated to Backup and Disaster Recovery, which is the highest
budget allocation followed by email hosting and productivity tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> A serverless architecture removes all barriers
that a standard IT infrastructure would usually bring. Users don’t have to
purchase or rent the servers that they run their data on. Instead, a
third-party will handle it all for you, allowing your organization to tackle
other tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Platform:</strong> As technology advances, one of the most common cloud
computing trends to look forward to is AI. Tech giants are now looking into
incorporating AI to process big data to improve their business functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Data theft, leakage, and deletion- security is a big
challenge even for traditional IT infrastructures. But, with more companies
moving to cloud platforms, it’s important to ensure that cloud service
providers can create an airtight security system to guarantee the safety of
their client’s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Platform:</strong> With a hyper-connected world, one of the most popular
cloud computing trends is the rise of IoT platforms. A study by Gartner
suggests the number of connected things in use will be going up to 25
billion by 2021 from 14.2 billion as of 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> It is a method of optimizing cloud computing network
system by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the
source of the data. It works real-time on the cloud servers to process less
time-sensitive data or store data for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevSecOps:</strong> Cloud computing services provide users with a seamless and
simple experience in managing their data but there are many security risks
involved.  The security risk of cloud computing includes network
eavesdropping, illegal invasion, denial of service attacks, side channel
attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Mesh:</strong> Since cloud platforms are complex, it is critical to
ensure that the platform has a fast and safe communication environment. With
a service mesh, users have a dedicated layer for service-to-service
communication, making their cloud platform highly dynamic and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> This industry is moving towards a path of innovation and
collaboration. With this shift in how cloud services are managed, many
organizations are looking at adopting an Open Source cloud computing service
for their business.</p>

<h2 id="containers"><a class="header" href="#containers">Containers</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with
dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and
libraries required to run your software services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary
elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the
operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public
cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources
at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in
which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they
actually run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits Of Containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of responsibility:</strong> Containerization provides a clear
separation of responsibility, as developers focus on application logic
and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and
management instead of application details such as specific software
versions and configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workload portability:</strong> Containers can run virtually anywhere, greatly
easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
systems; on virtual machines or on physical servers; on a developer’s
machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the public
cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application isolation:</strong> Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage,
and network resources at the operating system level, providing
developers with a view of the OS logically isolated from other
applications.</p>
