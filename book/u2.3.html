<ul>
<li>
<p>Risk management is one of the cloud computing environment controls which
aims to assess and manage risks related to cloud computing and to prevent
those risks from impacting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk-based approach of managing information systems is a holistic
activity that needs to be fully integrated into every aspect of the
organization, from planning to system development life cycle processes, to
security controls allocation and continuous monitoring. Therefore, a Risk
Management Framework (RMF) provides a disciplined and structured process
that integrates information security and risk management activities into the
system development life cycle. An RMF operates primarily at tier 3 in the
risk management hierarchy, but it can also have interactions at tier 1 and
tier 2.</p>

<h3 id="enterprise-wide-risk-management"><a class="header" href="#enterprise-wide-risk-management">Enterprise-Wide Risk Management</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enterprise-wide risk management (ERM) is a process of coordinated risk
management that places greater emphasis on co-operation among departments to
manage an organisation's range of risks as a whole. ERM offers a framework
to effectively manage uncertainty, respond to risk and exploit opportunities
as they arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five steps to ERM are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify Risk</li>
<li>Analyze Risk</li>
<li>Evaluate or Rank Risk</li>
<li>Treat Risk or Control Risk</li>
<li>Monitor and Review Risk</li>

<h3 id="types-of-risks-in-cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#types-of-risks-in-cloud-computing">Types of Risks in Cloud Computing</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of cloud
computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process in which
data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user, software, or
application. In a cloud computing environment, data loss occurs when our
sensitive data is somebody else's hands, one or more data elements can not be
utilized by the data owner, hard disk is not working properly, and software is
not updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs:</strong> As we all know, cloud computing is
completely depends on Internet, so it is compulsory to protect interfaces and
APIs that are used by external users. APIs are the easiest way to communicate
with most of the cloud services. In cloud computing, few services are available
in the public domain. These services can be accessed by third parties, so there
may be a chance that these services easily harmed and hacked by hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Data Breach is the process in which the confidential data
is viewed, accessed, or stolen by the third party without any authorization, so
organization's data is hacked by the hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Vendor lock-in is the of the biggest security risks in
cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their
services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different
platforms, that can cause difficulty moving one cloud to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased complexity strains IT staff:</strong> Migrating, integrating, and
operating the cloud services is complex for the IT staff. IT staff must require
the extra capability and skills to manage, integrate, and maintain the data to
the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectre &amp; Meltdown:</strong> Spectre &amp; Meltdown allows programs to view and steal
data which is currently processed on computer. It can run on personal computers,
mobile devices, and in the cloud. It can store the password, your personal
information such as images, emails, and business documents in the memory of
other running programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Denial of service (DoS) attacks occur
when the system receives too much traffic to buffer the server. Mostly, DoS
attackers target web servers of large organizations such as banking sectors,
media companies, and government organizations. To recover the lost data, DoS
attackers charge a great deal of time and money to handle the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account hijacking:</strong> Account hijacking is a serious security risk in cloud
computing. It is the process in which individual user's or organization's cloud
account (bank account, e-mail account, and social media account) is stolen by
hackers. The hackers use the stolen account to perform unauthorized activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-security-in-cloud"><a class="header" href="#data-security-in-cloud">Data Security in Cloud</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The three letters in &quot;CIA triad&quot; stand for Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability. The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis for the
development of security systems. They are used for finding vulnerabilities
and methods for creating solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core principles of information security and data governance—data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (known as the CIA triad)—also
apply to the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> protecting the data from unauthorized access and
disclosure</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> safeguard the data from unauthorized modification so it
can be trusted</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> ensuring the data is fully available and accessible
when it’s needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MORE DETAILED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Confidentiality involves the efforts of an organization
to make sure data is kept secret or private. To accomplish this, access to
information must be controlled to prevent the unauthorized sharing of
data—whether intentional or accidental. A key component of maintaining
confidentiality is making sure that people without proper authorization are
prevented from accessing assets important to your business. Conversely, an
effective system also ensures that those who need to have access have the
necessary privileges.</p>
<p>For example, those who work with an organization’s finances should be able
to access the spreadsheets, bank accounts, and other information related to
the flow of money. However, the vast majority of other employees—and perhaps
even certain executives—may not be granted access. To ensure these policies
are followed, stringent restrictions have to be in place to limit who can
see what.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> Integrity involves making sure your data is trustworthy and
free from tampering. The integrity of your data is maintained only if the
data is authentic, accurate, and reliable.</p>
<p>For example, if your company provides information about senior managers on
your website, this information needs to have integrity. If it is inaccurate,
those visiting the website for information may feel your organization is not
trustworthy. Someone with a vested interest in damaging the reputation of
your organization may try to hack your website and alter the descriptions,
photographs, or titles of the executives to hurt their reputation or that of
the company as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Even if data is kept confidential and its integrity
maintained, it is often useless unless it is available to those in the
organization and the customers they serve. This means that systems,
networks, and applications must be functioning as they should and when they
should. Also, individuals with access to specific information must be able
to consume it when they need to, and getting to the data should not take an
inordinate amount of time.</p>
<p>If, for example, there is a power outage and there is no disaster recovery
system in place to help users regain access to critical systems,
availability will be compromised. Also, a natural disaster like a flood or
even a severe snowstorm may prevent users from getting to the office, which
can interrupt the availability of their workstations and other devices that
provide business-critical information or applications. Availability can also
be compromised through deliberate acts of sabotage, such as the use of
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or ransomware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-issues"><a class="header" href="#security-issues">Security Issues</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data Loss is one of the issues faced in Cloud Computing. This
is also known as Data Leakage. As we know that our sensitive data is in the
hands of Somebody else, and we don’t have full control over our database. So if
the security of cloud service is to break by hackers then it may be possible
that hackers will get access to our sensitive data or personal files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interference of Hackers and Insecure API’s:</strong> As we know if we are talking
about the cloud and its services it means we are talking about the Internet.
Also, we know that the easiest way to communicate with Cloud is using API. So it
is important to protect the Interface’s and API’s which are used by an external
user. But also in cloud computing, few services are available in the public
domain. An is the vulnerable part of Cloud Computing because it may be possible
that these services are accessed by some third parties. So it may be possible
that with the help of these services hackers can easily hack or harm our data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Account Hijacking:</strong> Account Hijacking is the most serious security
issue in Cloud Computing. If somehow the Account of User or an Organization is
hijacked by Hacker. Then the hacker has full authority to perform Unauthorized
Activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing Service Provider:</strong> Vendor lock In is also an important Security
issue in Cloud Computing. Many organizations will face different problems while
shifting from one vendor to another. For example, An Organization wants to shift
from AWS Cloud to Google Cloud Services then they ace various problem’s like
shifting of all data, also both cloud services have different techniques and
functions, so they also face problems regarding that. Also, it may be possible
that the charges of AWS are different from Google Cloud, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Skill:</strong> While working, shifting o another service provider, need
an extra feature, how to use a feature, etc. are the main problems caused in IT
Company who doesn’t have skilled Employee. So it requires a skilled person to
work with cloud Computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attack:</strong> This type of attack occurs when the
system receives too much traffic. Mostly DoS attacks occur in large
organizations such as the banking sector, government sector, etc. When a DoS
attack occurs data is lost. So in order to recover data, it requires a great
amount of money as well as time to handle it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges"><a class="header" href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DDoS and Denial-of-Service Attacks:</strong> As more and more businesses and
operations move to the cloud, cloud providers are becoming a bigger target for
malicious attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are more common
than ever before. Verisign reported IT services, cloud platforms (PaaS) and SaaS
was the most frequently targeted industry during the first quarter of 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data breaches:</strong> Known data breaches in the U.S. hit a record-high of 738
in 2014, according to the Identity Theft Research Center, and hacking was (by
far) the number one cause. That’s an incredible statistic and only emphasizes
the growing challenge to secure sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data loss:</strong> When business critical information is moved into the cloud,
it’s understandable to be concerned with its security. Losing cloud data, either
through accidental deletion and human error, malicious tampering including the
installation of malware (i.e. DDoS), or an act of nature that brings down a
cloud service provider, could be disastrous for an enterprise business. Often a
DDoS attack is only a diversion for a greater threat, such as an attempt to
steal or delete data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure access control points:</strong> One of the great benefits of the cloud
is it can be accessed from anywhere and from any device. But, what if the
interfaces and particularly the application programming interfaces (APIs) users
interact with aren’t secure? Hackers can find and gain access to these types of
vulnerabilities and exploit authentication via APIs if given enough time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifications and alerts:</strong> Awareness and proper communication of security
threats is a cornerstone of network security and the same goes for cloud
computing security. Alerting the appropriate website or application managers as
soon as a threat is identified should be part of a thorough data security and
access management plan. Speedy mitigation of a threat relies on clear and prompt
communication so steps can be taken by the proper entities and impact of the
threat minimized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages"><a class="header" href="#advantages">Advantages</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>24×7 Visibility:</strong> The best cloud security solutions like AppTrana enable
24×7 monitoring of the application and cloud-based assets. This helps
organizations to have continuous visibility into their risk posture and its
impact on the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher Availability:</strong> Cloud computing security solutions typically have
built-in redundancies to ensure that the application/ resources are always
available. The CDNs used have distributed global networks of edge servers that
deliver content optimally, accelerate application performance, and minimize
access to the server. Together, they handle traffic surges in a way that
on-premises/ hardware solutions cannot.</p>

<p><strong>Effective protection against DDoS Attacks:</strong> Cloud security solutions
provide the most effective protection against DDoS attacks, which are increasing
in numbers, magnitude, sophistication, and severity. Cloud computing security
helps to continuously monitor, identify, analyze, and mitigate DDoS attacks. The
built-in redundancies, customizability, flexibility, scalability, and
intelligence of such solutions can prevent volumetric, low, and slow attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Security:</strong> The best cloud computing security solutions provide data
security by design. They have security protocols and policies such as strong
access controls and data encryption to prevent unauthorized entities from
accessing confidential information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay as you Go Model:</strong> The cloud security model ensures that you pay only
for what you use and consume as opposed to making any upfront investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced Threat Detection:</strong> By using end-point scanning and global threat
intelligence, cloud computing security can detect threats more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Top-notch cloud application security providers
help to ensure regulatory standards and industry-specific compliance needs. This
is done through its enhanced infrastructure and managed security services.</p>

<h3 id="disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages">Disadvantages</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of data confidentiality:</strong> There is always a risk that user data can
be accessed by other people. So data and cloud protection must be good because
if it won’t be dangerous for data confidentiality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depends on internet connection:</strong> The internet is the only way to cloud
computing. When there is no internet connection in your place, or the internet
path to the cloud provider is in trouble, automatically access to your cloud
computing machine will be disconnected. Now this is where the biggest obstacle
is happening in developing countries and remote areas that do not have good
internet access.And the weakness of public cloud is where everyone accesses the
same server and server and will increase the risk of attack, and down the
server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The level of security:</strong> Secrecy and security are among the most doubtful
things in cloud computing. By using a cloud computing system means we are fully
entrusted with the security and confidentiality of data to companies that
provide cloud computing servers. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue
the server for errors in the data. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue
the server for errors in the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance:</strong> Which refers to the risk of a level compliance deviation
from the provider against the regulations applied by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerable in the event of an attack:</strong> There are lots of arguments
against cloud computing one of which is computing because the Cloud Computing
work system is online, each component that is on Cloud Computing can be exposed
to a wide range, this is a wide open opportunity for attacks on data or
activities stored on the server. When an attack is carried out by hackers, the
problems that occur are data security, and data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Mobility:</strong> which refers to the possibility of sharing data between
cloud services and how to retrieve data if one day the user makes a process of
terminating cloud computing services.And there is local storage where the data
can be used at any time as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical problem:</strong> Besides that the use of Cloud Computing makes you
unable to manage it yourself when there is a problem or a problem, you must
contact customer support who is not necessarily ready 24/7. This is a problem
because for some support you also have to pay more money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low Connection:</strong> Does not work well if the connection is slow. The
quality of cloud computing servers is one of the most important considerations
before we decide to provide cloud computing server service providers. When the
server is down or the permorma is not good, we will be harmed because of poor
server quality.</p>

<p><strong>Top-of-the-Line Perimeter Firewall:</strong> Most firewalls are very simple—they
typically inspect a packet’s source and destination and that’s all. Some more
advanced firewalls feature stable packet inspection, which checks the integrity
of the file packets for stability issues prior to approving or rejecting the
packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems with Event Logging:</strong> Numerous IT security
compliance standards require businesses to have a means of tracking and
recording intrusion attempts. So, for any business that wants to meet compliance
standards such as PCI or HIPAA, using IDS event logging solutions is a must.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Firewalls for Individual Applications, and Databases:</strong> While
having a strong perimeter firewall can block external attacks, internal attacks
are still a major threat. Infrastructures that lack internal firewalls to
restrict access to sensitive data and applications cannot be considered secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data-at-Rest Encryption:</strong> Encrypting the data that is stored on your
cloud infrastructure can be an effective way to keep your most sensitive
information from being accessed by the wrong party.</p>
