<h2 id="introduction-to-big-data"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-big-data">Introduction to Big Data</a></h2>
<p>Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by
traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields offer
greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity may lead to a
higher false discovery rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Five <strong>V</strong>s of big data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Volume:</strong>	The amount of data matters. With big data, you’ll have to
process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. This can be data of
unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a web page or a
mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. For some organizations, this might
be tens of terabytes of data. For others, it may be hundreds of petabytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Velocity:</strong>	Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and
(perhaps) acted on. Normally, the highest velocity of data streams directly
into memory versus being written to disk. Some internet-enabled smart
products operate in real time or near real time and will require real-time
evaluation and action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variety:</strong>	Variety refers to the many types of data that are
available. Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a
relational database. With the rise of big data, data comes in new
unstructured data types. Unstructured and semistructured data types, such as
text, audio, and video, require additional preprocessing to derive meaning
and support metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Veracity:</strong> It refers to inconsistencies and uncertainty in data, that
is data which is available can sometimes get messy and quality and accuracy
are difficult to control. Big Data is also variable because of the multitude
of data dimensions resulting from multiple disparate data types and sources.
Example: Data in bulk could create confusion whereas less amount of data
could convey half or Incomplete Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> After having the 4 V’s into account there comes one more V
which stands for Value!. The bulk of Data having no Value is of no good to
the company, unless you turn it into something useful. Data in itself is of
no use or importance but it needs to be converted into something valuable to
extract Information. Hence, you can state that Value! is the most important
V of all the 5V’s.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big data benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big data makes it possible for you to gain more complete answers because
you have more information.</li>
<li>More complete answers mean more confidence in the data—which means a
completely different approach to tackling problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sources-of-big-data"><a class="header" href="#sources-of-big-data">Sources of Big Data</a></h2>
<p>The bulk of big data generated comes from three primary sources: social data,
machine data and transactional data. In addition, companies need to make the
distinction between data which is generated internally, that is to say it
resides behind a company’s firewall, and externally data generated which needs
to be imported into a system. Whether data is unstructured or structured is also
an important factor. Unstructured data does not have a pre-defined data model
and therefore requires more resources to make sense of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The three primary sources of  Big Data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Social data</strong> comes from the Likes, Tweets &amp; Retweets, Comments, Video
Uploads, and general media that are uploaded and shared via the world’s
favorite social media platforms. This kind of data provides invaluable
insights into consumer behavior and sentiment and can be enormously
influential in marketing analytics. The public web is another good
source of social data, and tools like Google Trends can be used to good
effect to increase the volume of big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine data</strong> is defined as information which is generated by
industrial equipment, sensors that are installed in machinery, and even
web logs which track user behavior. This type of data is expected to
grow exponentially as the internet of things grows ever more pervasive
and expands around the world. Sensors such as medical devices, smart
meters, road cameras, satellites, games and the rapidly growing Internet
Of Things will deliver high velocity, value, volume and variety of data
in the very near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transactional data</strong> is generated from all the daily transactions that
take place both online and offline. Invoices, payment orders, storage
records, delivery receipts – all are characterized as transactional data
yet data alone is almost meaningless, and most organizations struggle to
make sense of the data that they are generating and how it can be put to
good use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-analytic-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#data-analytic-lifecycle">Data Analytic Lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>The Data analytic lifecycle is designed for Big Data problems and data science
projects. The cycle is iterative to represent real project. To address the
distinct requirements for performing analysis on Big Data, step – by – step
methodology is needed to organize the activities and tasks involved with
acquiring, processing, analyzing, and repurposing data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are six phases in Data Analytics Lifecycle:</p>
<p><img src="pictures/phases.jpg" alt="Phases of Data Analytics Lifecycle" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> The data science team learn and investigate the problem.
Develop context and understanding. Come to know about data sources needed
and available for the project. The team formulates initial hypothesis that
can be later tested with data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Steps to explore, preprocess, and condition data
prior to modeling and analysis. It requires the presence of an analytic
sandbox, the team execute, load, and transform, to get data into the
sandbox. Data preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times
and not in predefined order. Several tools commonly used for this phase are
– Hadoop, Alpine Miner, Open Refine, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Model Planning:</strong> Team explores data to learn about relationships
between variables and subsequently, selects key variables and the most
suitable models. In this phase, data science team develop data sets for
training, testing, and production purposes. Team builds and executes models
based on the work done in the model planning phase. Several tools commonly
used for this phase are – Matlab, STASTICA.</li>
<li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Team develops datasets for testing, training, and
production purposes. Team also considers whether its existing tools will
suffice for running the models or if they need more robust environment for
executing models. Free or open-source tools – Rand PL/R, Octave, WEKA.
Commercial tools – Matlab , STASTICA.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Results:</strong> After executing model team need to compare
outcomes of modeling to criteria established for success and failure. Team
considers how best to articulate findings and outcomes to various team
members and stakeholders, taking into account warning, assumptions. Team
should identify key findings, quantify business value, and develop narrative
to summarize and convey findings to stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Operationalize:</strong> The team communicates benefits of project more
broadly and sets up pilot project to deploy work in controlled way before
broadening the work to full enterprise of users. This approach enables team
to learn about performance and related constraints of the model in
production environment on small scale  , and make adjustments before full
deployment. The team delivers final reports, briefings, codes. Free or open
source tools – Octave, WEKA, SQL, MADlib.</li>

<h2 id="applications-of-big-data"><a class="header" href="#applications-of-big-data">Applications of Big Data</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In today’s world, there are a lot of data. Big companies utilize those data for their business growth. By analyzing this data, the useful decision can be made in various cases as discussed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tracking Customer Spending Habit, Shopping Behavior:</strong> In big retails
store (like Amazon, Walmart, Big Bazar etc.) management team has to keep
data of customer’s spending habit (in which product customer spent, in
which band they wish to spent, how frequently they spent), shopping
behavior, customer’s most liked product (so that they can keep those
products in the store). Which product is being searched/sold most, based
on that data, production/collection rate of that product get fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> By tracking customer spending habit, shopping
behavior, Big retails store provide a recommendation to the customer.
E-commerce site like Amazon, Walmart, Flipkart does product
recommendation. They track what product a customer is searching, based on
that data they recommend that type of product to that customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Traffic System:</strong> Data about the condition of the traffic of
different road, collected through camera kept beside the road, at entry
and exit point of the city, GPS device placed in the vehicle (Ola, Uber
cab, etc.). All such data are analyzed and jam-free or less jam way, less
time taking ways are recommended. Such a way smart traffic system can be
built in the city by Big data analysis. One more profit is fuel
consumption can be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Air Traffic System:</strong> At various places of flight (like
propeller etc) sensors present. These sensors capture data like the speed
of flight, moisture, temperature, other environmental condition. Based on
such data analysis, an environmental parameter within flight are set up
and varied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto Driving Car:</strong> Big data analysis helps drive a car without human
interpretation. In the various spot of car camera, a sensor placed, that
gather data like the size of the surrounding car, obstacle, distance from
those, etc. These data are being analyzed, then various calculation like
how many angles to rotate, what should be speed, when to stop, etc
carried out. These calculations help to take action automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Personal Assistant Tool:</strong> Big data analysis helps virtual
personal assistant tool (like Siri in Apple Device, Cortana in Windows,
Google Assistant in Android) to provide the answer of the various
question asked by users. This tool tracks the location of the user, their
local time, season, other data related to question asked, etc. Analyzing
all such data, it provides an answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT:</strong> Manufacturing company install IOT sensor into machines to
collect operational data. Analyzing such data, it can be predicted how
long machine will work without any problem when it requires repairing so
that company can take action before the situation when machine facing a
lot of issues or gets totally down. Thus, the cost to replace the whole
machine can be saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Education Sector:</strong> Online educational course conducting organization
utilize big data to search candidate, interested in that course. If
someone searches for YouTube tutorial video on a subject, then online or
offline course provider organization on that subject send ad online to
that person about their course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Sector:</strong> Smart electric meter read consumed power every 15
minutes and sends this read data to the server, where data analyzed and
it can be estimated what is the time in a day when the power load is less
throughout the city. By this system manufacturing unit or housekeeper are
suggested the time when they should drive their heavy machine in the
night time when power load less to enjoy less electricity bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Media and Entertainment Sector:</strong> Media and entertainment service
providing company like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify do analysis on
data collected from their users. Data like what type of video, music
users are watching, listening most, how long users are spending on site,
etc are collected and analyzed to set the next business strategy.</p>
