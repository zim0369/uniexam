<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions
about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling,
data mining techniques and machine learning. Companies employ predictive
analytics to find patterns in this data to identify risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>Predictive analytics is often associated with big data and data science.
Companies today are swimming in data that resides across transactional
databases, equipment log files, images, video, sensors or other data sources. To
gain insights from this data, data scientists use deep learning and machine
learning algorithms to find patterns and make predictions about future events.
These include linear and nonlinear regression, neural networks, support vector
machines and decision trees. Learnings obtained through predictive analytics can
then be used further within prescriptive analytics to drive actions based on
predictive insights.</p>
<p>Python and R are two of the languages that are most commonly used for developing
predictive analytics applications.</p>
<h2 id="essential-python-libraries"><a class="header" href="#essential-python-libraries">Essential Python Libraries</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Numpy and Scipy:</strong> Fundamental Scientific Computing NumPy stands for
Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimensional array.
This library also contains basic linear algebra functions, Fourier
transforms, advanced random number capabilities and tools for integration
with other low level languages like Fortran, C and C++. SciPy stands for
Scientific Python. It is built on NumPy. Scipy is one of the most useful
library for variety of high level science and engineering modules like
discrete Fourier transform, Linear Algebra, Optimization and Sparse
matrices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pandas:</strong> Data Manipulation and Analysis Pandas for structured data
operations and manipulations. It is extensively used for data munging and
preparation. Pandas were added relatively recently to Python and have been
instrumental in boosting Python’s usage in data scientist community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> Plotting and Visualization Matplotlib for plotting vast
variety of graphs, starting from histograms to line plots to heat plots..
You can use Pylab feature in ipython notebook (ipython notebook –pylab =
inline) to use these plotting features inline. If you ignore the inline
option, then pylab converts ipython environment to an environment, very
similar to Matlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scikit-learn:</strong> Machine Learning and Data Mining Scikit Learn for machine
learning. Built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib, this library contains a lot
of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including
classification, regression, clustering and dimensional reduction.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="analytics-types"><a class="header" href="#analytics-types">Analytics Types:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Descriptive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Descriptive analytics looks at what has happened in the past. As the
name suggests, the purpose of descriptive analytics is to simply
describe what has happened; it doesn’t try to explain why this might
have happened or to establish cause-and-effect relationships. The aim is
solely to provide an easily digestible snapshot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Analytics is a good example of descriptive analytics in action;
it provides a simple overview of what’s been going on with your website,
showing you how many people visited in a given time period, for example,
or where your visitors came from. Similarly, tools like HubSpot will
show you how many people opened a particular email or engaged with a
certain campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two main techniques used in descriptive analytics: Data
aggregation and data mining. Data aggregation is the process of
gathering data and presenting it in a summarized format. Let’s imagine
an ecommerce company collects all kinds of data relating to their
customers and people who visit their website. The aggregate data, or
summarized data, would provide an overview of this wider dataset—such as
the average customer age, for example, or the average number of
purchases made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predictive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Predictive analytics seeks to predict what is likely to happen in the
future. Based on past patterns and trends, data analysts can devise
predictive models which estimate the likelihood of a future event or
outcome. This is especially useful as it enables businesses to plan
ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predictive models use the relationship between a set of variables to
make predictions; for example, you might use the correlation between
seasonality and sales figures to predict when sales are likely to drop.
If your predictive model tells you that sales are likely to go down in
summer, you might use this information to come up with a summer-related
promotional campaign, or to decrease expenditure elsewhere to make up
for the seasonal dip. Perhaps you own a restaurant and want to predict
how many takeaway orders you’re likely to get on a typical Saturday
night. Based on what your predictive model tells you, you might decide
to get an extra delivery driver on hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to forecasting, predictive analytics is also used for
classification. A commonly used classification algorithm is logistic
regression, which is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of
independent variables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prescriptive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prescriptive analytics looks at what has happened, why it happened, and
what might happen in order to determine what should be done next. In
other words, prescriptive analytics shows you how you can best take
advantage of the future outcomes that have been predicted. What steps
can you take to avoid a future problem? What can you do to capitalize on
an emerging trend?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescriptive analytics is, without doubt, the most complex type of
analysis, involving algorithms, machine learning, statistical methods,
and computational modeling procedures. Essentially, a prescriptive model
considers all the possible decision patterns or pathways a company might
take, and their likely outcomes. This enables you to see how each
combination of conditions and decisions might impact the future, and
allows you to measure the impact a certain decision might have. Based on
all the possible scenarios and potential outcomes, the company can
decide what is the best “route” or action to take.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="association-rules"><a class="header" href="#association-rules">Association Rules:</a></h2>
<p>Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for
discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is
intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of
interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association
rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items
are connected.</p>
<p>Association rule learning is a great system for predicting the behavior in data
interconnections. This makes it a noteworthy technique for classification, or
discovering patterns in data, when implementing machine learning methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> There are many benefits of using Association rules like
finding the pattern that helps understand the correlations and
co-occurrences between data sets. A very good real-world example that uses
Association rules would be medicine. Medicine uses Association rules to help
diagnose patients. When diagnosing patients there are many variables to
consider as many diseases will share similar symptoms. With the use of the
Association rules, doctors can determine the conditional probability of an
illness by comparing symptom relationships from past cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Downfalls:</strong> However, Association rules also lead to many different
downfalls such as finding the appropriate parameter and threshold settings
for the mining algorithm. But there is also the downfall of having a large
number of discovered rules. The reason is that this does not guarantee
that the rules will be found relevant, but it could also cause the
algorithm to have low performance. Sometimes the implemented algorithms
will contain too many variables and parameters. For someone that doesn’t
have a good concept of data mining, this might cause them to have trouble
understanding it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="apriori-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#apriori-algorithm">Apriori Algorithm</a></h3>
<p>Apriori algorithm is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for finding
frequent itemsets in a dataset for boolean association rule. Name of the
algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset
properties. We apply an iterative approach or level-wise search where k-frequent
itemsets are used to find k+1 itemsets.</p>
<p>To improve the efficiency of level-wise generation of frequent itemsets, an
important property is used called Apriori property which helps by reducing the
search space.</p>
<p><strong>Apriori Property:</strong> All non-empty subset of frequent itemset must be frequent.
The key concept of Apriori algorithm is its anti-monotonicity of support
measure. Apriori assumes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent(Apriori property). If an
itemset is infrequent, all its supersets will be infrequent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="fp-growthfrequent-pattern-growth-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#fp-growthfrequent-pattern-growth-algorithm">FP growth(Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm)</a></h3>
<p>Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm This algorithm is an improvement to the
Apriori method. A frequent pattern is generated without the need for candidate
generation. FP growth algorithm represents the database in the form of a tree
called a frequent pattern tree or FP tree.</p>
<p>This tree structure will maintain the association between the itemsets. The
database is fragmented using one frequent item. This fragmented part is called
“pattern fragment”. The itemsets of these fragmented patterns are analyzed. Thus
with this method, the search for frequent itemsets is reduced comparatively.</p>

<h2 id="regression"><a class="header" href="#regression">Regression</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regression, one of the most common types of machine learning models,
estimates the relationships between variables. Whereas classification models
identify which category an observation belongs to, regression models
estimate a numeric value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of data science, regression specifically refers to the
estimation of a continuous dependent variable or response from a list of
input variables, or features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regression is essential for any machine learning problem that involves
continuous numbers, which includes a vast array of real-life applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial forecasting, such as estimating housing or stock prices</li>
<li>Automobile testing</li>
<li>Weather analysis</li>
<li>Time series forecasting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-regression"><a class="header" href="#linear-regression">Linear Regression</a></h3>
<p>Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning
algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis.
Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables
such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.</p>
<p>Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y)
and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression.
Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how
the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the
independent variable.</p>

<h3 id="logistic-regression"><a class="header" href="#logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</a></h3>
<p>Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete
outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a
binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no,
and so on. Multinomial logistic regression can model scenarios where there are
more than two possible discrete outcomes. Logistic regression is a useful
analysis method for classification problems, where you are trying to determine
if a new sample fits best into a category. As aspects of cyber security are
classification problems, such as attack detection, logistic regression is a
useful analytic technique.</p>

<h2 id="classification"><a class="header" href="#classification">Classification</a></h2>
<p>Data Classification is the process of organizing data into categories for its
most effective and efficient use.</p>
<p>In a time where nearly everything is digitized, from personal records to highly
sensitive corporate data, it's about time we take a closer look into
classification. Data classification in data science refers to the process that
tags and categorizes any kind of data so that it can be better understood and
analyzed. The latter is what we'll be focusing on.</p>
<p>But also, a well-planned data classification system makes essential data easy to
find and retrieve. This can be of particular importance for risk management,
legal discovery, and compliance.</p>

<h3 id="naïve-bayes"><a class="header" href="#naïve-bayes">Naïve Bayes</a></h3>
<p>In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple &quot;probabilistic
classifiers&quot; based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence
assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the
simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation,
they can achieve high accuracy levels.</p>
<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters
linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem.
Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression,
which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as
used for many other types of classifiers.</p>

<h3 id="decision-trees"><a class="header" href="#decision-trees">Decision Trees</a></h3>
<p>A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or
make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered. The
model is a form of supervised learning, meaning that the model is trained and
tested on a set of data that contains the desired categorization.</p>
<p>The decision tree may not always provide a clear-cut answer or decision.
Instead, it may present options so the data scientist can make an informed
decision on their own. Decision trees imitate human thinking, so it’s generally
easy for data scientists to understand and interpret the results.</p>
