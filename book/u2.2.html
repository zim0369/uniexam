<p><strong>Data Management and Data Transfer:</strong> To run HPC applications in the AWS
cloud, you need to move the required data into the cloud. There are several data
transport solutions designed to securely transfer huge amounts of data. This
overcomes issues like a long time for transfer, high network costs, and security
concerns. Also, you can automate the movement of data between the AWS cloud and
on-premises storage. There are options for establishing a private connection to
the AWS from your premises. This increases bandwidth to provide more throughput,
reduces the cost of the network, and provides a consistent network experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compute &amp; Networking:</strong> There are several compute instances types that can
be customized according to your needs. It also handles monitoring your
application and adjusting its capacity for maintaining a steady and predictable
performance at an affordable cost. Also, setting up application scaling across
multiple services for multiple resources takes a few minutes. Enhanced
networking options from AWS allow achieving lower inter-instance latency and
higher bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> When looking for an HPC solution, you need to consider the
storage options and cost. There are several flexible blocks, object, and file
storage options in AWS services that allow permanent and transient data storage.
It allows allocating storage volumes according to the size you need. You can
store and access and data type over the cloud without doing a data migration
project. Also, with AWS services, you can transfer your workload to the cloud
from on-premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation and Orchestration:</strong> For using the infrastructure efficiently,
you need to automate scheduling submitted jobs and the job submission process.
AWS services allow you to run thousands of batch computing jobs through the
dynamic provision of the computer resources on the basis of the requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operations and Management:</strong> As a system administrator, you are
responsible for avoiding cost overruns and monitoring the infrastructure. There
are several management and monitoring services that allow you to optimize
utilization of resources, monitor the application, get a complete view of
operational health, and respond to the performance changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visualization:</strong> With the AWS services, you can easily visualize the
engineering simulations’ results without moving huge amounts of data. Now, you
can access the interactive applications remotely over a standard network and
deliver application sessions to any workstation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> For running applications on the cloud, you need
to have an understanding of regulatory compliance and security management. There
are several quick-launch templates and security related services offered by AWS
that helps in protecting data and customer privacy by putting strong safeguards
in the AWS infrastructure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing
platform, Amazon Web Services, that allows users to rent virtual computers
on which to run their own computer applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EC2 refers to an on-demand computing service on the AWS cloud platform.
Under computing, it includes all the services a computing device can offer
to you along with the flexibility of a virtual environment. It also allows
the user to configure their instances as per their requirements i.e.
allocate the RAM, ROM, and storage according to the need of the current
task. Even the user can dismantle the virtual device once its task is
completed and it is no more required. For providing, all these scalable
resources AWS charges some bill amount at the end of every month, bill
amount is entirely dependent on your usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features of Amazon EC2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> EC2 provides its users a true virtual computing
platform, where they can various operations and even launch another EC2
instance from this virtually created environment. This will increase the
security of these virtual devices. Not only creating but also EC2 allows
us to customize our environment as per our requirements, at any point of
time during the life span of this virtual machine. Amazon EC2 itself
comes with a set of default AMI(Amazon Machine Image) options supporting
various operating systems along with some pre-configured resources like
RAM, ROM, storage, etc. Besides these AMI options, we can also create an
AMI curated with the combination of default and user-defined
configurations. And for future purposes, we can store this user-defined
AMI, so that next time, the user won’t have to re-configure a new AMI
from scratch. Rather than this whole process, the user can simply use
the older reference while creating a new EC2 machine.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Amazon EC2 includes a wide range of operating
systems to choose from while selecting your AMI. Not only these selected
options, but users are also even given the privileges to upload their
own operating systems and opt for that while selecting AMI during
launching an EC2 instance. Currently, AWS has the following most
preferred set of operating systems available on the EC2 console.
<ul>
<li>Amazon Linux</li>
<li>Windows Server</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>SUSE Linux</li>
<li>Red Hat Linux</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> Amazon is single-handedly ruling the cloud computing market,
because of the variety of options available on it for its users. It allows
its users to choose from various software present to run on their EC2
machines. This whole service is allocated to AWS Marketplace on the AWS
platform. Numerous software like SAP, LAMP and Drupal, etc are available on
AWS to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability and Reliability:</strong> EC2 provides us the facility to scale up or
scale down as per the needs. All dynamic scenarios can easily be tackled by
EC2 with the help of this feature. And because of the flexibility of volumes
and snapshots, it is highly reliable for its users. Due to the scalable
nature of the machine, many organizations like Flipkart, Amazon rely on days
whenever humongous traffic occurs on their portals.</p>

center with servers, or hosting the data on a personal computer.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Sharing facilitates collaboration. As healthcare
information is meant to stay confidential, with the cloud, the data can be
securely shared among all the relevant healthcare stakeholders like doctors,
nurses, and care-givers that, too, in real-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Healthcare data needs to stay confidential. The abundant data
held by this domain makes it a focal point of attraction to the malicious
actors, resulting in security and data breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Cloud can hold an enormous amount of information at a very minimal
cost. Cloud computing works on the pay-as-you-go and subscription model,
which indicates you only have to pay for those services which you are
availing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> Cloud-based tools can update and upgrade their features at a
commendable pace with minimal intervention, and you can get real-time updates
as well on all the relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Cloud facilitates technologies that are used
in healthcare like electronic medical records, mobile apps, patient portals,
devices with IoT, big data analytics.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ECG analysis in cloud computing</strong>: cloud computing technologies allows the
remote monitoring of a patient's heart beat data. Through this way the
patient at risk can be constantly monitored without going to the hospital
for ECG analysis. At the same time the Doctor's can instantly be notified
with cases that need's their attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ECG is just a visual image of a record of the electrical activity of the
heart muscle as it varies over time, typically printed on paper for easier
study. Similarly, like other muscles, the heart contracts in response to
electrical depolarization caused in the muscle cells. When it's the time of
day, it's the amount of the electrical activity, when amplified and registered
for just a few seconds that we call a heart rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With ECG data collection and tracking, it's possible to test for chest pain,
low-grade heart rhythm disturbances, arrhythmias, and more. An E-G
(electrocardiogram) is the electrical expression of the contractile movement
of the myocardium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since cloud computing systems are now readily available and deliver the
services in less time, it's got the promise to be a massive disruptor to
how the technology is distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a consequence, the doctor doesn't need to put a huge effort into
computing, since there is a lot of software on which to run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud infrastructure is highly scalable; it can be maximized and
minimized according to the needs of each user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud computing (or cloud computing) systems are now available and aim
to provide reliable services to consumers with less time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The doctor's office would not need to invest in a broad computer system.</p>

<h4 id="protein-structure-prediction"><a class="header" href="#protein-structure-prediction">Protein Structure Prediction</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protein structure prediction is the best example in research area that makes
use of cloud applications for its computation and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A protein is composed of long chains of amino acids joined together by
peptide bonds. The various structures of protein help in the designing of
new drugs and the various sequences of proteins from its three-dimensional
structure in predictive form is known as a Protein structure prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly primary structures of proteins are formed and then prediction of the
secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures are done from the primary one.
In this way predictions of protein structures are done. Protein structure
prediction also makes use of various other technologies like artificial
neural networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning and probabilistic
techniques, also holds great importance in fields like theoretical chemistry
and bioinformatics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are various algorithms and tools that exists for protein structure
prediction. CASP (Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) is a
well-known tool that provides methods for automated web servers and the
results of research work are placed on clouds like CAMEO (Continuous
Automated Model Evaluation) server. These servers can be accessed by anyone
as per their requirements from any place. Some of the tools or servers used
in protein structure prediction are Phobius, FoldX, LOMETS, Prime, Predict
protein, SignalP, BBSP, EVfold, Biskit, HHpred, Phre, ESyired3D. Using these
tools new structures are predicted and the results are placed on the
cloud-based servers.</p>

<h4 id="satellite-image-processing"><a class="header" href="#satellite-image-processing">Satellite Image Processing,</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Satellite Image Processing is an important field in research and development
and consists of the images of earth and satellites taken by the means of
artificial satellites. Firstly, the photographs are taken in digital form
and later are processed by the computers to extract the information.
Statistical methods are applied to the digital images and after processing
the various discrete surfaces are identified by analyzing the pixel values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Majorly there are four kinds of resolutions associated with satellite
imagery. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spatial resolution:</strong> It is determined by the sensors Instantaneous
Field of View(IFoV) and is defined as the pixel size of an image that is
visible to the human eye being measured on the ground. Since it has high
resolving power or the ability to separate and hence is termed as
Spatial Resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral resolution:</strong> This resolution measures the wavelength
internal size and determines the number of wavelength intervals that the
sensor measures.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal resolution:</strong> The word temporal is associated with time or
days and is defined as the time that passes between various imagery
cloud periods.</li>
<li><strong>Radiometric resolution:</strong> This resolution provides the actual
characteristics of the image and is generally expressed in bits size. It
gives the effective bit depth and records the various levels of
brightness of imaging system.</li>

<h4 id="social-networking"><a class="header" href="#social-networking">Social Networking</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social networks help boost internet usability by storing heavy multimedia
content in cloud storage systems. Videos and photographs are the most
popular content on social media, which essentially use up the maximum space
allocated to them. They have the capacity to slow down applications and
servers with all of their resource demands. Cloud computing vendors such as
Salesforce and Amazon nowadays provide varied services including Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). As
they deliver these things through cloud servers, clients can use the
flexibility and scalability of the system without purchasing standalone
software or hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from data storage, the social networks are now also using clouds for
various other tasks. For example, this can be ideal for big data analytics.
One of the benefits of using cloud systems is that users can access vast
amount of structured and even non-structured data easily. Just take a look
at the much-improved analytics provided by sites like Facebook, especially
for its business users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way cloud computing becomes helpful is by reducing the cost of data
backup and recovery in case of a disaster. If the data is only stored in one
central location, it becomes much riskier. If something happens there, it is
almost impossible to recover the data. But through cloud they remain
accessible through shared resources across the globe. This is especially
useful for social networks as the store personal data of its users, and so
cannot afford to lose even one part of it.</p>
