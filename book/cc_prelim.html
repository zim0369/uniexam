<p><strong>Define virtualization and write down different types of virtualization.</strong>
<strong>Explain Network and Storage Virtualization in detail.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization in cloud computing allows a provider to virtualize
servers, storage, or other physical hardware or data center resources,
which can then, in turn, allow them to provide numerous services such as
infrastructure, software, and platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 7 Types of Virtualization</p>
<ol>
<li>OS Virtualization—aka Virtual Machines</li>
<li>Application-Server Virtualization</li>
<li>Application Virtualization</li>
<li>Administrative Virtualization</li>
<li>Network Virtualization</li>
<li>Hardware Virtualization</li>
<li>Storage Virtualization</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storage virtualization in Cloud Computing is nothing but the sharing
of physical storage into multiple storage devices which further
appears to be a single storage device. It can be also called as a
group of an available storage device which simply manages from a
central console.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This virtualization provides numerous benefits such as easy backup,
achieving, and recovery of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This whole process requires very less time and works in an efficient
manner. Storage virtualization in Cloud Computing does not show the
actual complexity of the Storage Area Network (SAN). This
virtualization is applicable to all levels of SAN.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network Virtualization is a process of logically grouping physical
networks and making them operate as single or multiple independent
networks called Virtual Networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools for Network Virtualization :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physical switch OS:</strong> It is where the OS must have the
functionality of network virtualization.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor:</strong> It is which uses third-party software or
built-in networking and the functionalities of network
virtualization.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantages of Network Virtualization :</p>
<ol>
<li>Improves manageability</li>
<li>Improves utilization</li>

<p><strong>NEEDS REFACTORING</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization allows addressing multiple problems in Grid systems, such
as coping with the heterogeneity of Grid resources, the difference in
software stacks, and enhanced features in resource management such as
more general check pointing or migration models. Adopting virtualization
in smart ways gets us closer to real Grid computing with more ﬂexibility
in the type of applications and the resources to use.</p>

<p><strong>Explain CPU virtualization in detail.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization is a hardware feature found in all current AMD &amp;
Intel CPUs that allows a single processor to act as if it was multiple
individual CPUs.This allows an operating system to more effectively &amp;
efficiently utilize the CPU power in the computer so that it runs
faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization improves performance and efficiency to a greater
extent because virtual machines work on a single CPU, sharing resources
is actually like using multiple processors at the same time. This saves
Cost and Money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of CPU Virtualization</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware-assisted CPU Virtualization :</strong> Hardware supports CPU
Virtualization through certain processors like Guest User. This Uses
different versions of code and the mode is known as a Guest mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software-based CPU Virtualization :</strong> This type of CPU
Virtualization is software-based and it helps application code to get
executed on a processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtualization and Processor-Specific behavior:</strong> Although this
software virtualizes the CPU, the virtual machine can detect the model
of a processor on which it is running, processor models may differ in
CPU features they offer and applications running on these CPUs may use
these features.</p>

<p><strong>Explain in detail Amazon Web Services &amp; its components.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides
on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies,
and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing
web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and
software tools via AWS server farms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly
adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from
data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the
fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government
agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate
faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS Components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Management and Data Transfer:</strong> To run HPC applications in
the AWS cloud, you need to move the required data into the cloud. There
are several data transport solutions designed to securely transfer huge
amounts of data. This overcomes issues like a long time for transfer,
high network costs, and security concerns. Also, you can automate the
movement of data between the AWS cloud and on-premises storage. There
are options for establishing a private connection to the AWS from your
premises. This increases bandwidth to provide more throughput, reduces
the cost of the network, and provides a consistent network experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compute &amp; Networking:</strong> There are several compute instances types
that can be customized according to your needs. It also handles
monitoring your application and adjusting its capacity for maintaining a
steady and predictable performance at an affordable cost. Also, setting
up application scaling across multiple services for multiple resources
takes a few minutes. Enhanced networking options from AWS allow
achieving lower inter-instance latency and higher bandwidth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> When looking for an HPC solution, you need to consider
the storage options and cost. There are several flexible blocks, object,
and file storage options in AWS services that allow permanent and
transient data storage. It allows allocating storage volumes according
to the size you need. You can store and access and data type over the
cloud without doing a data migration project. Also, with AWS services,
you can transfer your workload to the cloud from on-premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation and Orchestration:</strong> For using the infrastructure
efficiently, you need to automate scheduling submitted jobs and the job
submission process. AWS services allow you to run thousands of batch
computing jobs through the dynamic provision of the computer resources
on the basis of the requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operations and Management:</strong> As a system administrator, you are
responsible for avoiding cost overruns and monitoring the
infrastructure. There are several management and monitoring services
that allow you to optimize utilization of resources, monitor the
application, get a complete view of operational health, and respond to
the performance changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visualization:</strong> With the AWS services, you can easily visualize
the engineering simulations’ results without moving huge amounts of
data. Now, you can access the interactive applications remotely over a
standard network and deliver application sessions to any workstation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> For running applications on the cloud,
you need to have an understanding of regulatory compliance and security
management. There are several quick-launch templates and security
related services offered by AWS that helps in protecting data and
customer privacy by putting strong safeguards in the AWS
infrastructure.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Explain in detail Elastic Cloud Computing(EC2).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing
platform, Amazon Web Services, that allows users to rent virtual computers
on which to run their own computer applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features of Amazon EC2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality:</strong> EC2 provides its users a true virtual computing
platform, where they can various operations and even launch another
EC2 instance from this virtually created environment. This will
increase the security of these virtual devices. Not only creating
but also EC2 allows us to customize our environment as per our
requirements, at any point of time during the life span of this
virtual machine. Amazon EC2 itself comes with a set of default
AMI(Amazon Machine Image) options supporting various operating
systems along with some pre-configured resources like RAM, ROM,
storage, etc. Besides these AMI options, we can also create an AMI
curated with the combination of default and user-defined
configurations. And for future purposes, we can store this
user-defined AMI, so that next time, the user won’t have to
re-configure a new AMI from scratch. Rather than this whole process,
the user can simply use the older reference while creating a new EC2
machine.</li>
<li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Amazon EC2 includes a wide range of operating
systems to choose from while selecting your AMI. Not only these
selected options, but users are also even given the privileges to
upload their own operating systems and opt for that while selecting
AMI during launching an EC2 instance. Currently, AWS has the
following most preferred set of operating systems available on the
EC2 console.
<ul>
<li>Amazon Linux</li>
<li>Windows Server</li>
<li>Ubuntu Server</li>
<li>SUSE Linux</li>
<li>Red Hat Linux</li>

<p>An ECG is just a visual image of a record of the electrical
activity of the heart muscle as it varies over time, typically
printed on paper for easier study. Similarly, like other
muscles, the heart contracts in response to electrical
depolarization caused in the muscle cells. When it's the time of
day, it's the amount of the electrical activity, when amplified
and registered for just a few seconds that we call a heart
rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With ECG data collection and tracking, it's possible to test for
chest pain, low-grade heart rhythm disturbances, arrhythmias,
and more. An E-G (electrocardiogram) is the electrical
expression of the contractile movement of the myocardium.</p>

<p><strong>Biology:</strong> Cloud computing is an emerging technology that provides
various computing services on demand. It provides convenient access to a
shared pool of higher-level services and other system resources.
Nowadays, cloud computing has a great significance in the fields of
geology, biology, and other scientific research areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Protein Structure Prediction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protein structure prediction is the best example in research
area that makes use of cloud applications for its computation
and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A protein is composed of long chains of amino acids joined
together by peptide bonds. The various structures of protein
help in the designing of new drugs and the various sequences of
proteins from its three-dimensional structure in predictive form
is known as a Protein structure prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly primary structures of proteins are formed and then
prediction of the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures
are done from the primary one. In this way predictions of
protein structures are done. Protein structure prediction also
makes use of various other technologies like artificial neural
networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning and
probabilistic techniques, also holds great importance in fields
like theoretical chemistry and bioinformatics.</p>

<p><strong>Explain different types of risks in cloud computing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In many ways, the security threats facing today’s traditional data
center environments overlap with those of a cloud computing environment.
On both sides, cybercriminals aim to take advantage of vulnerabilities
found in software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several security risks to consider when making the switch to
cloud computing. Here are 5 of the top security risks your organization
should be aware of:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Data loss is the most common cloud security risks of
cloud computing. It is also known as data leakage. Data loss is the process
in which data is being deleted, corrupted, and unreadable by a user,
software, or application. In a cloud computing environment, data loss occurs
when our sensitive data is somebody else's hands, one or more data elements
can not be utilized by the data owner, hard disk is not working properly,
and software is not updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacked Interfaces and Insecure APIs:</strong> As we all know, cloud computing
is completely depends on Internet, so it is compulsory to protect interfaces
and APIs that are used by external users. APIs are the easiest way to
communicate with most of the cloud services. In cloud computing, few
services are available in the public domain. These services can be accessed
by third parties, so there may be a chance that these services easily harmed
and hacked by hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Breach:</strong> Data Breach is the process in which the confidential
data is viewed, accessed, or stolen by the third party without any
authorization, so organization's data is hacked by the hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor lock-in:</strong> Vendor lock-in is the of the biggest security risks
in cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring their
services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different
platforms, that can cause difficulty moving one cloud to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased complexity strains IT staff:</strong> Migrating, integrating, and
operating the cloud services is complex for the IT staff. IT staff must
require the extra capability and skills to manage, integrate, and maintain
the data to the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spectre &amp; Meltdown:</strong> Spectre &amp; Meltdown allows programs to view and
steal data which is currently processed on computer. It can run on personal
computers, mobile devices, and in the cloud. It can store the password, your
personal information such as images, emails, and business documents in the
memory of other running programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Denial of service (DoS) attacks
occur when the system receives too much traffic to buffer the server.
Mostly, DoS attackers target web servers of large organizations such as
banking sectors, media companies, and government organizations. To recover
the lost data, DoS attackers charge a great deal of time and money to handle
the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Account hijacking:</strong> Account hijacking is a serious security risk in
cloud computing. It is the process in which individual user's or
organization's cloud account (bank account, e-mail account, and social media
account) is stolen by hackers. The hackers use the stolen account to perform
unauthorized activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain in detail cloud security services:</strong> <em>Confidentiality,</em>
<em>Integrity, &amp;</em> <em>Availability</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The three letters in &quot;CIA triad&quot; stand for Confidentiality, Integrity,
and Availability. The CIA triad is a common model that forms the basis
for the development of security systems. They are used for finding
vulnerabilities and methods for creating solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core principles of information security and data governance—data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (known as the CIA
triad)—also apply to the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> protecting the data from unauthorized access
and disclosure</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> safeguard the data from unauthorized modification so
it can be trusted</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> ensuring the data is fully available and
accessible when it’s needed</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain need of secure cloud software requirements.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You need a secure way to immediately access your data. Cloud security
ensures your data and applications are readily available to authorized
users. You'll always have a reliable method to access your cloud
applications and information, helping you quickly take action on any
potential security issues.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Top-of-the-Line Perimeter Firewall:</strong> Most firewalls are very
simple—they typically inspect a packet’s source and destination and that’s
all. Some more advanced firewalls feature stable packet inspection, which
checks the integrity of the file packets for stability issues prior to
approving or rejecting the packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems with Event Logging:</strong> Numerous IT security
compliance standards require businesses to have a means of tracking and
recording intrusion attempts. So, for any business that wants to meet
compliance standards such as PCI or HIPAA, using IDS event logging solutions
is a must.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Firewalls for Individual Applications, and Databases:</strong> While
having a strong perimeter firewall can block external attacks, internal
attacks are still a major threat. Infrastructures that lack internal
firewalls to restrict access to sensitive data and applications cannot be
considered secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data-at-Rest Encryption:</strong> Encrypting the data that is stored on your
cloud infrastructure can be an effective way to keep your most sensitive
information from being accessed by the wrong party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tier IV Data Centers with Strong Physical Security:</strong> The physical
hardware used to run a cloud environment represents one last opportunity for
hackers and industrial spies to steal your most important data. When allowed
direct access to the hardware that runs the cloud, hackers have free reign
to steal data or upload malware directly to your systems.</p>

<p><strong>Explain future trends in cloud computing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Future Trends in Cloud Computing</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid/ Multi-Cloud Solutions:</strong> Hybrid cloud computing refers to
using a combination of the private cloud as well as a third-party public
cloud service. It is primarily used to allow workloads to move between
private and public clouds, giving users more flexibility with their
computing needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup And Disaster Recovery:</strong> Cyber attacks, data outages, and
system failures are a part and parcel of running a business these days.
Most businesses have dealt with their servers crashing, leading to loss
of critical data files. To ensure such issues don’t damage the
organization and its processes, backup and disaster recovery has become
a trending use case of the cloud. If Spiceworks reports are to be
believed, 15% of the cloud budget is allocated to Backup and Disaster
Recovery, which is the highest budget allocation followed by email
hosting and productivity tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> A serverless architecture removes all
barriers that a standard IT infrastructure would usually bring. Users
don’t have to purchase or rent the servers that they run their data on.
Instead, a third-party will handle it all for you, allowing your
organization to tackle other tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Platform:</strong> As technology advances, one of the most common
cloud computing trends to look forward to is AI. Tech giants are now
looking into incorporating AI to process big data to improve their
business functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Data theft, leakage, and deletion- security is a
big challenge even for traditional IT infrastructures. But, with more
companies moving to cloud platforms, it’s important to ensure that cloud
service providers can create an airtight security system to guarantee
the safety of their client’s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Platform:</strong> With a hyper-connected world, one of the most
popular cloud computing trends is the rise of IoT platforms. A study by
Gartner suggests the number of connected things in use will be going up
to 25 billion by 2021 from 14.2 billion as of 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> It is a method of optimizing cloud computing
network system by performing data processing at the edge of the network,
near the source of the data. It works real-time on the cloud servers to
process less time-sensitive data or store data for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevSecOps:</strong> Cloud computing services provide users with a
seamless and simple experience in managing their data but there are many
security risks involved.  The security risk of cloud computing includes
network eavesdropping, illegal invasion, denial of service attacks, side
channel attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud
services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Mesh:</strong> Since cloud platforms are complex, it is critical
to ensure that the platform has a fast and safe communication
environment. With a service mesh, users have a dedicated layer for
service-to-service communication, making their cloud platform highly
dynamic and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> This industry is moving towards a path of
innovation and collaboration. With this shift in how cloud services are
managed, many organizations are looking at adopting an Open Source
cloud computing service for their business.</p>

<p><strong>Explain Docker and Kubernetes in detail.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level
virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The
service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the
containers is called Docker Engine.</p>
</li>
