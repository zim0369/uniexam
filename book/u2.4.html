<h2 id="future-trends-in-cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#future-trends-in-cloud-computing">Future Trends in Cloud Computing</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid/ Multi-Cloud Solutions:</strong> Hybrid cloud computing refers to using a
combination of the private cloud as well as a third-party public cloud
service. It is primarily used to allow workloads to move between private and
public clouds, giving users more flexibility with their computing needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup And Disaster Recovery:</strong> Cyber attacks, data outages, and system
failures are a part and parcel of running a business these days. Most
businesses have dealt with their servers crashing, leading to loss of
critical data files. To ensure such issues don’t damage the organization and
its processes, backup and disaster recovery has become a trending use case
of the cloud. If Spiceworks reports are to be believed, 15% of the cloud
budget is allocated to Backup and Disaster Recovery, which is the highest
budget allocation followed by email hosting and productivity tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> A serverless architecture removes all barriers
that a standard IT infrastructure would usually bring. Users don’t have to
purchase or rent the servers that they run their data on. Instead, a
third-party will handle it all for you, allowing your organization to tackle
other tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Platform:</strong> As technology advances, one of the most common cloud
computing trends to look forward to is AI. Tech giants are now looking into
incorporating AI to process big data to improve their business functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Data theft, leakage, and deletion- security is a big
challenge even for traditional IT infrastructures. But, with more companies
moving to cloud platforms, it’s important to ensure that cloud service
providers can create an airtight security system to guarantee the safety of
their client’s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Platform:</strong> With a hyper-connected world, one of the most popular
cloud computing trends is the rise of IoT platforms. A study by Gartner
suggests the number of connected things in use will be going up to 25
billion by 2021 from 14.2 billion as of 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> It is a method of optimizing cloud computing network
system by performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the
source of the data. It works real-time on the cloud servers to process less
time-sensitive data or store data for the long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DevSecOps:</strong> Cloud computing services provide users with a seamless and
simple experience in managing their data but there are many security risks
involved.  The security risk of cloud computing includes network
eavesdropping, illegal invasion, denial of service attacks, side channel
attacks, virtualization vulnerabilities, and abuse of cloud services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Mesh:</strong> Since cloud platforms are complex, it is critical to
ensure that the platform has a fast and safe communication environment. With
a service mesh, users have a dedicated layer for service-to-service
communication, making their cloud platform highly dynamic and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> This industry is moving towards a path of innovation and
collaboration. With this shift in how cloud services are managed, many
organizations are looking at adopting an Open Source cloud computing service
for their business.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cloud Computing opened the opportunity for media operators who serve content
providers, IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) operators and multimedia
players. When we consider multimedia players, adopting cloud computing is
often one of the important priorities in the coming years. Some media
players, for example, companies like media post-production, already utilize
these kinds of cloud computing–based service capabilities for managing the
digital delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the future, multimedia companies will use cloud computing first, who
started looking to move their storage requirements into cloud computing. The
cost and the investment return for these kinds of services have accelerated.</p>

<h3 id="iptv"><a class="header" href="#iptv">IPTV</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is the delivery of television content
over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This is in contrast to delivery
through traditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable television formats.
Unlike downloaded media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media
continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the
content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as
streaming media.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Cloud infrastructures are increasingly becoming essential components for
providing Internet services. By benefiting from economies of scale, Clouds
can efficiently manage and offer a virtually unlimited number of resources
and can minimize the costs incurred by organizations when providing Internet
services. However, as Cloud providers often rely on large data centres to
sustain their business and offer the resources that users need, the energy
consumed by Cloud infrastructures has become a key environmental and
economical concern.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Jungle computing is a form of high performance computing that distributes
computational work across cluster, grid and cloud computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The increasing complexity of the high performance computing environment has
provided a range of choices beside traditional supercomputers and clusters.
Scientists can now use grid and cloud infrastructures, in a variety of
combinations along with traditional supercomputers - all connected via fast
networks. And the emergence of many-core technologies such as GPUs, as well
as supercomputers on chip within these environments has added to the
complexity. Thus, high-performance computing can now use multiple diverse
platforms and systems simultaneously, giving rise to the term &quot;computing
jungle&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-cloud-computing-vs-edge-computing"><a class="header" href="#distributed-cloud-computing-vs-edge-computing">Distributed Cloud Computing Vs Edge Computing</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A distributed cloud is an architecture where multiple clouds are used to
meet compliance needs, performance requirements, or support edge computing
while being centrally managed from the public cloud provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In essence, a distributed cloud service is a public cloud that runs in
multiple locations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public cloud provider’s infrastructure</li>
<li>The public cloud provider’s infrastructure</li>
<li>In another cloud provider’s data center</li>
<li>On third party or colocation center hardware</li>

<h2 id="containers"><a class="header" href="#containers">Containers</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with
dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and
libraries required to run your software services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary
elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the
operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public
cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Containers make it easy to share CPU, memory, storage, and network resources
at the operating systems level and offer a logical packaging mechanism in
which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they
actually run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits Of Containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of responsibility:</strong> Containerization provides a clear
separation of responsibility, as developers focus on application logic
and dependencies, while IT operations teams can focus on deployment and
management instead of application details such as specific software
versions and configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workload portability:</strong> Containers can run virtually anywhere, greatly
easing development and deployment: on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating
systems; on virtual machines or on physical servers; on a developer’s
machine or in data centers on-premises; and of course, in the public
cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application isolation:</strong> Containers virtualize CPU, memory, storage,
and network resources at the operating system level, providing
developers with a view of the OS logically isolated from other
applications.</p>

<p><strong>Home cloud computing</strong> is the process of using a remote server to store,
manage and access data and applications from home. It allows users to access
their files, applications, and other digital content from any device with an
internet connection, whether it be a computer, phone, or tablet. Private
cloud computing can also be used to back up data and protect the information
in case of emergencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of individuals and small businesses use home/private cloud computing
to browse, search through files and even work on projects from any device.
It’s a great alternative to setting up a server in your house because it
eliminates the need for physical storage devices that contain data.</p>
