<ul>
<li>Virtualization in cloud computing allows a provider to virtualize servers,
storage, or other physical hardware or data center resources, which can
then, in turn, allow them to provide numerous services such as
infrastructure, software, and platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adopting-virtualization"><a class="header" href="#adopting-virtualization">Adopting Virtualization</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some users may confuse virtualization with cloud computing, but they’re not
entirely the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization is the creation of a virtual resource such as a server,
desktop, operating system, file, storage space, or network to help
businesses manage and scale workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud computing is the sharing of resources, software, applications and
data as a service. Together, the two can be used to provide even greater
advantages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data virtualization is viable for small businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While virtualization was first embraced by enterprise operations, it soon
became clear that the same value proposition held substantial benefits for
Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs). Cyberattacks and natural disasters can
hit businesses of all sizes. For SMBs, backing up a virtualized
infrastructure can be a more viable option to backing up hardware servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasons to adopt virtualization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased agility for the business</li>
<li>Better resource deployment</li>
<li>Greater operational efficiency</li>
<li>Enhanced security</li>
<li>Higher availability</li>
<li>Stronger disaster recovery</li>
<li>Improved quality of service</li>
<li>Reduced energy consumption</li>
<li>Preparation for the cloud</li>

<h3 id="virtualization-architecture"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-architecture">Virtualization architecture</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A virtualization architecture is a conceptual model specifying the
arrangement and interrelationships of the particular components involved in
delivering a virtual -- rather than physical -- version of something, such
as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network
resources.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="virtualization-software"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-software">Virtualization software</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization software, also called hypervisor, allows a single host
computer to create and run one or more virtual environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization software is most often used to emulate a complete computer
system in order to allow a guest operating system to be run, for example
allowing Linux to run as a guest on top of a PC that is natively running a
Microsoft Windows operating system (or the inverse, running Windows as a
guest on Linux).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses of virtualization software:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Back up</strong>: You can backup your entire operating system or server
installation as a virtual OS.</li>
<li><strong>Run a different OS</strong>: Let's say you want to try out Linux without
having to install it on a physical hard drive.</li>
<li><strong>Run ancient apps</strong>: Say an application you want to run only works on
win8 and you're using win10 then instead of reinstalling an outdated OS on
real hardware why not just install windows 8 in a VM.</li>
<li><strong>Look at dirty files</strong>: Taking a look at malicious files might put your
computer and your data at risk so it would be better to check it in a
sandboxed environment.</li>
<li><strong>Using sandboxed browsers</strong>: Hackers have successfully exploited all
four of most popular browsers — Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and
Safari. Browser plugins can be malicious too. In this case using a sandboxed
browser like the TOR browser is safer.</li>
<li><strong>Try an application</strong>: You just want to check if an application you
wrote works well on multiple operating systems then using virtual machines
would be more convenient as compared to installing on real hardware.</li>

<h2 id="virtual-applications"><a class="header" href="#virtual-applications">Virtual Applications</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtual apps are applications that are optimized to run in a virtual
environment. Simply put, a virtual app simply runs on a computer without
being installed on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote apps are a popular virtual app delivery solution wherein the virtual
applications installed on a server are delivered to users’ devices. These
applications are not installed on the user’s device; instead, software
called a client is installed on the device that connects to the server, and
the application is presented as screenshots sent to the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ThinApp is an example of an agentless application virtualization solution,
while Microsoft App-V represents an agent-based virtual app solution.
Parallels Remote Application Server, Citrix, and VMware are the leading
providers of application virtualization solutions in the market.</p>

<h2 id="grid-cloud--virtualization"><a class="header" href="#grid-cloud--virtualization">Grid, Cloud &amp; Virtualization</a></h2>
<h3 id="grid-computing"><a class="header" href="#grid-computing">Grid Computing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grid Computing can be defined as a network of computers working together to
perform a task that would rather be difficult for a single machine. All
machines on that network work under the same protocol to act as a virtual
supercomputer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task that they work on may include analyzing huge datasets or simulating
situations that require high computing power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computers on the network contribute resources like processing power and
storage capacity to the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grid computing is also called as &quot;distributed computing.&quot; It links multiple
computing resources (PC's, workstations, servers, and storage elements)
together and provides a mechanism to access them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main advantages of grid computing are that it increases user
productivity by providing transparent access to resources, and work can be
completed more quickly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloud"><a class="header" href="#cloud">Cloud</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;The cloud&quot; refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the
software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located
in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and
companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software
applications on their own machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from
almost any device, because the computing and storage takes place on servers
in a data center, instead of locally on the user device. This is why a user
can log in to their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone
breaks and still find their old account in place, with all their photos,
videos, and conversation history. It works the same way with cloud email
providers like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, and with cloud storage
providers like Dropbox or Google Drive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="virtualization"><a class="header" href="#virtualization">Virtualization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization in cloud computing is defined as a creation of a virtual
version of a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system, or
network resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization in cloud computing allows a provider to virtualize servers,
storage, or other physical hardware or data center resources, which can
then, in turn, allow them to provide numerous services such as
infrastructure, software, and platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical
instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and
organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage and
providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of Virtualization:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is
directly installed on the hardware system is known as hardware
virtualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main job of hypervisor is to control and monitoring the processor,
memory and other hardware resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After virtualization of hardware system we can install different
operating system on it and run different applications on those OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Hardware virtualization is mainly done for the server
platforms, because controlling virtual machines is much easier than
controlling a physical server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating System Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is
installed on the Host operating system instead of directly on the
hardware system is known as operating system virtualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Operating System Virtualization is mainly used for testing
the applications on different platforms of OS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Server Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is
directly installed on the Server system is known as server
virtualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Server virtualization is done because a single physical
server can be divided into multiple servers on the demand basis and for
balancing the load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Storage virtualization is the process of grouping the physical storage
from multiple network storage devices so that it looks like a single
storage device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage virtualization is also implemented by using software
applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Storage virtualization is mainly done for back-up and
recovery purposes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network Virtualization is a process of logically grouping physical
networks and making them operate as single or multiple independent
networks called Virtual Networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools for Network Virtualization :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physical switch OS:</strong> It is where the OS must have the
functionality of network virtualization.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor:</strong> It is which uses third-party software or built-in
networking and the functionalities of network virtualization.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<!-- TODO: Refactoring virtualization in grid -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operating System virtualizations are just a use of software which allows the
hardware of a system to run multiple operating systems concurrently. This
further provides the benefit to run multiple applications requiring a
different operating system on a single computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualization allows addressing multiple problems in Grid systems, such as
coping with the heterogeneity of Grid resources, the difference in software
stacks, and enhanced features in resource management such as more general
check pointing or migration models. Adopting virtualization in smart ways
gets us closer to real Grid computing with more ﬂexibility in the type of
applications and the resources to use.</p>

<h3 id="virtualization-in-cloud"><a class="header" href="#virtualization-in-cloud">Virtualization in Cloud</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtualization plays a very important role in the cloud computing
technology, normally in the cloud computing, users share the data present in
the clouds like application etc, but actually with the help of
virtualization users shares the Infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main usage of Virtualization Technology is to provide the applications
with the standard versions to their cloud users, suppose if the next version
of that application is released, then cloud provider has to provide the
latest version to their cloud users and practically it is possible because
it is more expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To overcome this problem we use basically virtualization technology, By
using virtualization, all severs and the software application which are
required by other cloud providers are maintained by the third party people,
and the cloud providers has to pay the money on monthly or annual basis.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Cloud security, also known as cloud computing security, is a collection of
security measures designed to protect cloud-based infrastructure,
applications, and data. These measures ensure user and device
authentication, data and resource access control, and data privacy
protection. They also support regulatory data compliance. Cloud security is
employed in cloud environments to protect a company's data from distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malware, hackers, and unauthorized user
access or use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of clouds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Public clouds:</strong> Public cloud services are hosted by third-party cloud
service providers. A company doesn't have to set up anything to use the
cloud, since the provider handles it all. Usually, clients can access a
provider's web services via web browsers. Security features, such as access
control, identity management, and authentication, are crucial to public
clouds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private clouds:</strong> Private clouds are typically more secure than public
clouds, as they're usually dedicated to a single group or user and rely on
that group or user's firewall. The isolated nature of these clouds helps
them stay secure from outside attacks since they're only accessible by one
organization. However, they still face security challenges from some
threats, such as social engineering and breaches. These clouds can also be
difficult to scale as your company's needs expand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid clouds:</strong> Hybrid clouds combine the scalability of public
clouds with the greater control over resources that private clouds offer.
These clouds connect multiple environments, such as a private cloud and a
public cloud, that can scale more easily based on demand. Successful hybrid
clouds allow users to access all their environments in a single integrated
content management platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud security is critical since most organizations are already using cloud
computing in one form or another. This high rate of adoption of public cloud
services is reflected in Gartner’s recent prediction that the worldwide
market for public cloud services will grow 23.1% in 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtualized security, or security virtualization, refers to security
solutions that are software-based and designed to work within a virtualized
IT environment. This differs from traditional, hardware-based network
security, which is static and runs on devices such as traditional firewalls,
routers, and switches.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Anatomy of Cloud Computing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Provisioning and Configuration Module:</strong> It is the lowest level of
cloud and typically resides on bare hardware (as a firmware) or on the
top of the hypervisor layer. Its function is to abstract the underlying
hardware and provide a standard mechanism to spawn instance of virtual
machine on demand. It also handles the post-configuration of the
operating systems and applications residing on the VM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Optimization:</strong> This layer handles the monitoring of
all services, storage, networking and applications components in cloud.
Based on the statistics, it could perform routine functions that
optimize the behavior of the infrastructure components and provide
relevant data to the cloud administrator to further optimize the
configuration for maximum utilization and performance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metering and Chargeback:</strong> This layer provides functions to measure
the usage of resources in cloud. The metering module collects all the
utilization data per domain per use. This module gives the cloud
administrator enough data to measure ongoing utilization of resources
and to create invoices based on the usage on a periodic basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Orchestration is a central to cloud operations.
Orchestration converts requests from the service management layer and
the monitoring, chargeback modules to appropriate action item which are
then submitted to provisioning and configuration module for final
closure. Orchestration updates the CMDB in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration Management Database (CMDB):</strong> It is a central
configuration repository wherein all the meta data and configuration of
different modules, resources are kept and updated in the real-time
basis. The repository can then be accessed using standards protocols
like SOAP by third-party software and integration components. All
updates in CMDB happen in real time as requests get processed in cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud Life cycle Management Layer (CLM):</strong> This layer handles the
coordination of all other layers in cloud. All requests internal and
external are addressed to the CLM layer first. CLM may internally route
requests and actions to other layers for further processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Catalog:</strong> It is central to the definition of cloud, SC
defines what kind of services the cloud is capable of providing and at
what cost to the end user. SC is the first thing that is drafted before
a cloud is architecture. The service management layer consults SC before
it processes any request for a new resource.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A virtual infrastructure allows you to utilise the IT capabilities of
physical resources as software that can be used across multiple platforms.
These resources are shared across multiple virtual machines (VMs) and
applications for maximum efficiency, creating a virtual infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits of virtual infrastructure</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> By consolidating servers, virtualization reduces
capital and operating costs associated with variables such as electrical
power, physical security, hosting and server development.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> A virtual infrastructure allows organizations to react
quickly to changing customer demands and market trends by ramping up on
CPU utilization or scaling back accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Increased productivity:</strong> Faster provisioning of applications and
resources allows IT teams to respond more quickly to employee demands
for new tools and technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified server management:</strong> Simplified server management makes
sure IT teams can spin up, or down, virtual machines when required and
re-provision resources based on real-time needs.</li>

<h3 id="cpu-virtualization"><a class="header" href="#cpu-virtualization">CPU Virtualization</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization is a hardware feature found in all current AMD &amp; Intel
CPUs that allows a single processor to act as if it was multiple individual
CPUs.This allows an operating system to more effectively &amp; efficiently
utilize the CPU power in the computer so that it runs faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization emphasizes performance, running apps/programs, and runs
directly on the processor whenever possible. All operations are controlled
by an emulator that controls software to run accordingly, CPU Virtualisation
is not the same as emulation. The emulator works the same as a normal
computer machine does, it makes a copy of data and generates the same output
as a physical machine does. The emulation function gives a feeling of
working on multiple platforms while being on a single platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization helps all the virtual machines to behave like physical
machines and distribute their physical resources like virtual machines
sharing their physical memories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU Virtualization improves performance and efficiency to a greater extent
because virtual machines work on a single CPU, sharing resources is actually
like using multiple processors at the same time. This saves Cost and Money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of CPU Virtualization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware-assisted CPU Virtualization :</strong> Hardware supports CPU
Virtualization through certain processors like Guest User. This Uses
different versions of code and the mode is known as a Guest mode. The best
part of hardware-assisted CPU Virtualization is, it doesn’t need any
translation while we use it for Hardware assistance. In short, it uplifts
system calls and makes them run faster than expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software-based CPU Virtualization :</strong> This type of CPU Virtualization
is software-based and it helps application code to get executed on a
processor. First, the privileged code gets translated, and then translated
code is directly executed on the processor. This translation process is
known as Binary Translation. The translated code is slow in execution and is
very large at the same time. Guest programs that are programmed in
privileged coding run very smoothly and fast. Applications with privileged
coding would run slower comparatively in a virtual environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtualization and Processor-Specific behavior:</strong> Although this
software virtualizes the CPU, the virtual machine can detect the model of a
processor on which it is running, processor models may differ in CPU
features they offer and applications running on these CPUs may use these
features. Therefore it is not possible to use v motion to transfer virtual
machines running on processors with different feature sets.</p>

<p>Storage virtualization in Cloud Computing is nothing but the sharing of physical
storage into multiple storage devices which further appears to be a single
storage device. It can be also called as a group of an available storage device
which simply manages from a central console.</p>
